The midi-length piece featured gold buttons down the front in two vertical lines with a crisp collar. Princess Josephine also borrowed a pair of earrings from her mother to mark the special occasion – a pair of gold drop earrings with pink gemstones that Queen Mary previously wore in 2016 to the Stephen Hawking 'Quantum Black Holes' lecture in Copenhagen with a pink summer dress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7680fc8a3533-princess-josephine-wave.jpg><p id=ed-5vGw62Y data-wc=100>The young royal wore her hair tied in a half-up style and wore a light touch of makeup for the historic event. Her mother looked every inch a queen as she made history as she became the first Australian-born Queen of Denmark. <a class=hm-link href=#>Mary was seen wearing an angelic white gown</a> designed by Copenhagen-based fashion brand Soeren Le Schmidt. The piece featured a sweeping neckline and regal draped fabric that trailed down her back. Her brunette locks were swept her brunette hair into a ballerina-esque bun which revealed her revealing the glittering Danish Ruby Parure Earrings, a staple in her collection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3f705033bd8d-queen-mary-earrings.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="HELLO!'s new club for its biggest royal fans is here" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d4147deae939-new.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="HELLO!'s new club for its biggest royal fans is here" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>HELLO!'s new club for its biggest royal fans is here</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark make a 'great team' in marriage and royal life" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/58f68505034d-gettyimages-1932476366.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark make a 'great team' in marriage and royal life" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark make a 'great team' in marriage and royal life</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="10 best photos from King Frederik and Queen Mary's accession day" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/80e18d8a0612-danish-abdication.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="10 best photos from King Frederik and Queen Mary's accession day" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>10 best photos from King Frederik and Queen Mary's accession day</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: King Frederik and Queen Mary appear on the balcony during his accension</figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3e10d200530-princess-josephine-looking-up.jpg><p id=e8fZ4asf3p data-wc=129>Josephine was seen waving from the balcony with her parents and siblings. Their Majesties were even seen in their first royal kiss moment of their reign. Josephine's spirited conduct on the big day has led royal fans to<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;dub her the Danish Prince Louis</a>. She waved enthusiastically to the crowd, and at one point posed with a hand on her hip as she smiled next to her mother. <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Louis</a>, the son of the <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess of Wales</a> is known for his spirited behaviour at public events. He was even seen publicly shushing his mother Princess Kate at the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022 and was seen acting like any other five-year-old at an RAF flypast from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during Trooping the Colour in 2023.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b63ea10eb8f1-louis-shushes-kate.jpg><p id=e9DxPO9_YX data-wc=95>It has been a week of sublime fashion moments for the Danish royal family. The King and Queen stepped out on Tuesday minus their three children for their first appearance since their accession. The Queen looked so elegant in what appeared to be an Audrey Hepburn-inspired look. She paired her Ole Yde and Birgit Hallstein navy jacket which was a peplum style with a scalloped detail across the bust and a cinched waist. She added the matching navy skirt by Ole Yde which was an A-line style that we have seen the royal in before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8a90f1de8e41-shutterstockeditorial14300920r.jpg><p id=eimoXs3H0M data-wc=15><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Mary of Denmark's 10 beautiful bridal looks: Grecian gowns, form-fitting frocks and more&nbsp;</a></p><p id=e1I3ue3dfX data-wc=72>Mary added a dramatic Susanne Juul hat with a feather detail, alongside a pair of chic navy leather gloves and coordinating leather pumps by Gianvito Rossi, a favourite with Princess Kate. She rounded off her look with the ‘Konvo’ clutch in navy croc print by 1602 and her jewellery was dazzling. The mother-of-three donned the Connaught sapphire brooch and a pair of diamond earrings in the shape of daisies by Bruun Rasmussen.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
