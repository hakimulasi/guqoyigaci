Recently, however, some have been trying to attack him for allegedly acting inappropriately towards his manager mocking him and imitating him in various ways while smoking on a private jet.</p><p>It appears that this was all in good humor, though. Post Malone has recently explained that he has a very strong bond with his manager, Dre London, and the two have been through a lot together.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zjO-ahBOI/</p><p>With that in mind, they have also developed some inside jokes that they have been bringing out into the open from time to time with varying results.</p><p>It does not seem like Post Malone expected the negative feedback that he got for his recent actions, but the rapper was quick to make things right and explain the situation to anyone who might be listening.</p><p>It does not look like this was too necessary though, as most of Malone‚Äôs fans have been supportive of him in any case.</p><p>One fan said: ‚ÄúI love him so so much. üòÇ How can you ever get mad at Austin? Look at that cutie. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù</p><p>Another commenter stated: ‚ÄúThe vision is everything tho!!! That‚Äôs how you know y‚Äôall is tight. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è‚Äù</p><p>The rapper has managed to build a cult following over the years, and many have described him as the most lovable personality in rap at the moment.</p><p>He seems to be enjoying that reputation too, as he has made a lot of effort to maintain it and has pushed his career forward in the same direction.</p><p>In a new interview, Post Malone revealed how much he admired the late Mac Miller and he stated: ‚ÄúMac was the first one that tweeted me. It‚Äôs so weird because I listened to him since the beginning. I was like, ‚ÄòYeah, awesome. This guy‚Äôs cool as sh*t.‚Äô Then to be able to meet him and become friends with him was just like, ‚ÄòI look up to you, and now we‚Äôre sitting here playing beer pong.'‚Äù</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Viral posts on social media can go sideways very fast.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegpMC1ecyao6imlWK0psDSZpqapJyasW671K1kn6eiYrqwr8qipaBlmJ7AbrnAp5ignaJisbOxjKWmp5yfo3qquoynnLBlpp6xpruMoqpmrJiav6Z5zKipnmWkpHq1tMRmqq2noq56dH6TcWtyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./passion-java-net-worth.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Passion Java net worth</span></a>
