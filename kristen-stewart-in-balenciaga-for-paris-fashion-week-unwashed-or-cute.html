These are pics of Kristen arriving at the Balenciaga show during Paris Fashion Week today. She’s wearing head-to-toe Balenciaga, I think. I know the outfit is Balenciaga, and I’m assuming the boots are as well. Kristen is likely contractually obligated to appear at the Balenciaga shows in Paris – such a hardship, I know. She was just in Paris in the spring for Balenciaga too.</p><p>As for her outfit… I’m assuming Nicolas Ghesquière just tells her what to wear, so this is more HIS vision of the label than hers. I can’t say that I’m a big fan of these quilted Balenciaga jackets that Kristen has been wearing for months – they look so dated, and they’re really just NOT cute. But I do kind of like the pants. Shocking, I know. I would like to see the pants with a black turtleneck sweater and a pair of kickass black heels.</p><p>As for everything else… did she actually shower? Unknown. Her hair looks dirty to me, so the whole “showering” thing really is up in the air. Her makeup looks decent, although her (admittedly kickass) makeup person needs to work on the bags under her eyes. But maybe we’re supposed to see the bags and think about all of her sleepless nights, crying and begging Robert Pattinson to forgive her. Those bags are the “dog whistle” for Twihards.</p><p>Kristen only spoke to Women’s Wear Daily while at the show, as far as I can see. And even then, she only gave them two quotes:</p><p>Leaden skies over Paris greeted “Twilight” star Kristen Stewart as she arrived at this morning’s Balenciaga show. “Yeah, I guess I’m used to it,” she said with a smile.</p><p>The actress, who fronts Balenciaga’s Florabotanica scent, said she’s still hunting for her next film project, but if she had her druthers, it would be a screen adaptation of “Lie Down in Darkness,” a novel by William Styron about a dysfunctional family. “It’s hard to get a movie like that made nowadays,” said the petite star, dressed in a yellow biker jacket and printed black jeans.</p><p><a href=#>[From WWD]</a></p><p>So much to analyze! LOL. She was smiling, so obviously she’s back with Sparkles. She won’t confirm that she’s doing Lie Down in Darkness, which is interesting because there were rumors that the film was a go, with Kristen attached. It sounds like the studio might not want to make it anymore? Maybe they’re just waiting to see how all of this Twihard crap plays out over the next few months? Further proof that the reconciliation with Sparkles is mostly about protecting their careers, I think.</p><p><a href=#>The UK papers</a> are saying Kristen caused a “frenzy” at the show, and that she was seated next to Anna Wintour in the front row. Epic.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wenn4101109.jpg alt title=wenn4101109 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wenn4101102.jpg alt title=wenn4101102 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899050.jpg alt title=FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899050 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899047.jpg alt title=FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899047 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899049.jpg alt title=FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899049 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899056.jpg alt title=FFN_CHP_Stewart_Hayek_092712_50899056 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN, Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma21kZYNze8qroKyslaOstMDEsJirrI%2Beu6CuwKWcp5uZlrSiq8WoqZiokae2tKvFmqqhoZ%2BjrLixxKSWrqanlsCpscOYpquXk6rBpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sunny-philadelphia-review-flowers-charlie-season-9-episode-8.html><span>←</span><span>Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Review: Flowers For Charlie (Season 9, Episode 8)</span></a>
