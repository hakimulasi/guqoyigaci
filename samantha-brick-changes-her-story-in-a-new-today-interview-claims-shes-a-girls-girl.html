Yesterday, <a href=#>we covered Brick’s appearance on a British morning show,</a> and I have to admit – I think the British morning show did a superior job. This morning, Ann Curry took the reins instead of Matt Lauer (probably because Lauer would have been called a bully), and while Ann had me laughing right out of the gate (“Are you serious?”), this interview is kind of meh. Brick now claims that she wrote <a href=#>her epic “JELLY H8R” treatise</a> as “obviously, parts were tongue-and-cheek.” Brick also claims that she didn’t write the headline… like the headline (“There are downsides to looking this pretty”) was the most offensive thing. Except that Brick says her original headline was “Why does the sisterhood hate attractive women?” Yeah… much less offensive? Sidenote: Brick’s styling has improved greatly for this appearance.</p><p>Visit msnbc.com for <a href=#>breaking news</a>, <a href=#>world news</a>, and <a href=#>news about the economy</a></p><p>We get it, bitch. You live in the French countryside. ENOUGH. Stop mentioning it! I don’t understand why she keeps saying that… is that the new version of “It’s not my fault”? I live in the French countryside, don’t call me delusional. I live in the French countryside, don’t call me arrogant and self-absorbed.</p><p>She’s also saying that it was a first-person piece and it’s not about ALL women – except that she did in fact draw from her own alleged experiences as a mind-blowingly gorgeous woman and claim flat-out that all women are jealous of her looks and treat her badly. When Ann calls her out for her vanity and narcissism, Brick’s story changes once again and she claims to be a “girl’s girl” with “a fantastic circle of girlfriends.” Girlfriends that are obviously extremely jealous of her, I’m sure.</p><p>I don’t understand how Samantha claims to be “mortified” by the reactions to her piece. She’s not the kind of woman who admits when she’s wrong. Even now, she’s not admitting anything, she’s simply changing her story to fit her own sense of martyrdom, like she’s once again been proven right – that everyone is attacking her for being beautiful and self-confident, and she’s the biggest victim in the world. Basically, she’s an a–hole.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/samantha-brick-22.jpg alt title="samantha brick 2" width=576 height=388 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/samantha-brick-31.jpg alt title="samantha brick 3" width=570 sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Today, The Mail.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2lpaYJ1e9KapJqmpJ2uoK7Ropqkl5Odrq%2BzxKyWoZ2ilMC1u9GylqKmj5asr7HWmKuonJGurKq6056pr6GVrKykuMCipKyXo52ytKvAmJ6iqpyorKi10aVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-reynolds-quips-dad-of-four-fathers-day-nod-blake-lively-vasectomy.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Reynolds quips 'somehow I keep having kids' in Father's Day nod involving Blake Lively watc</span></a>
