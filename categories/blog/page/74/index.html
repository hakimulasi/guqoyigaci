<a href=../../../../what-does-tim-johnson-the-mad-dog-symbolize-html.html></a>
Answer
Tim Johnson embodies the aggressive, crazed prejudice that has swept across the city. The residents of Maycomb, like the dog, take action despite the fact that they do not consider all of the facts. Due to his fear of handling the dog, the sheriff is unable to kill it and instead asks Atticus for assistance. Tim Johnson, the rabid dog, is a representation of racism.
