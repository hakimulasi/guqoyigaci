Well, I heard that you‚Äôre leavin‚Äô,
Gonna leave me far behind,
‚ÄòCause you found a brand new lover,
You decided that I‚Äôm not your kind,
So I pulled your name out of my Rolodex,
And I tore all your pictures in two,
And I burned down the malt shop where we used to go,
Just because it reminds me of you.
That‚Äôs right, you ain‚Äôt gonna see me cryin‚Äô.
