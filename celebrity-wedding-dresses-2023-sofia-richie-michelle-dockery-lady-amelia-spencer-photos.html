Lionel Richie's daughter wore two beautiful Chanel gowns, starting with an embellished halterneck one with the couple's initials and the wedding date sewn into the inner lining.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNKo-p46UUo data-wc=56>Sofia told her Instagram followers that it wasn't the style she originally had in mind: "I always had this vision of the big princess dress and going big, but as I got older, I realised that I wanted something a bit more simple... Maybe ‘simple’ isn’t the right word because my dress definitely is not simple!"</p><p id=e2qCzgv2gce data-wc=12>She later changed into a structured mini dress for the evening reception.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Lady Amelia Spencer</h2><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Inside Lady Amelia Spencer and Greg Mallett's sunset wedding ©Vision on Fire</figure><p id=eE14KX0XNPp data-wc=17><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Lady Amelia Spencer</a> looked ethereal as she <a class=hm-link href=#>wed Greg Mallett</a> in a mountaintop ceremony in South Africa.</p><p id=eiYlVLLAjGC data-wc=35>The niece of the late Princess Diana chose a<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;custom Versace bridal gown</a> that took two and a half months to create, thanks to its two-and-a-half metre train, hand-embroidered neckline and intricate Swarovski crystal embellishments.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Simone Biles</h2><p id=etcNnFzqS4Yz data-wc=32>Olympic gymnast Simone Biles had two beautiful weddings with Jonathan Owens – one in Harris County Courthouse in Houston, Texas in April and another in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico the following month.</p><p id=ebPi6hXRIlo6 data-wc=47>The first was a much more low-key affair, with Simone opting for a halterneck frock with a tiered skirt in rooftop photos. She later picked out a more <a class=hm-link href=#>elaborate corset Galia Lahav gown</a> with a ballgown skirt and a leg split that she didn't expect to like.</p><p id=eZM6A06snVO_ data-wc=29>"I went with my gut feeling and what I felt the most beautiful in," Simone told Vogue. "I actually got a dress that I originally said I wouldn’t like."</p><p id=eBEi9sBLHKhT data-wc=37>She added: "I was nervous about having a ball gown because I’m so petite – but it works perfect. The leg slit was very crucial. It was to add, in my head, more length to my body."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Michelle Dockery</h2><p id=eXdL3SY8DSb3 data-wc=53>How beautiful did Downton Abbey star <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Dockery</a> look in her pleated <a class=hm-link href=#>Emilia Wickstead dress</a>?

We are immensely grateful to all for making it a day and a night to remember. Honeymoon here we come!"</p><h2 dir=ltr>Carrie Hope Fletcher</h2><p id=eIDcWjp1mQ-T data-wc=46>West End star Carrie Hope Fletcher chose two very different wedding dresses for her two weddings with Joel Montague. The couple first<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;tied the knot in Gretna Green</a> in February, with the actress stepping out in a white Phase Eight gown and a dried flower crown.</p><p id=ed_UqDAhJEhm data-wc=55>Six months later, she gathered her friends and family, including her famous brother Tom Fletcher, for a bigger wedding at Marleybrook House near Canterbury.
