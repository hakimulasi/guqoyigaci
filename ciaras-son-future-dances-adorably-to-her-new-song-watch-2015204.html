Due out in just two weeks, the singer’s sixth studio album includes the featured track “All Good.”</p><p>Led by the single “I Bet,” Jackie is the “Body Party” singer’s first project since she and ex Future, 31, parted ways. The two previously worked on music together, recording the song “Where You Go” for Ciara’s self-titled 2013 album.&nbsp;</p><p>“It clearly didn’t work out,” <a href=#>Ciara told The Breakfast Club</a> last week of her engagement. “But I have the greatest gift, the greatest joy of my life is my son.
