Just in case you need a simple salary calculator, that works out to be approximately $19.85 an hour.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-start-a-lineman-career></span>How do I start a lineman career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most positions offered four years of paid apprenticeship on-the-<b>job</b> training (7,000 hours) as well as in-classroom training before becoming a Journeyman <b>Lineman</b>. To advance to becoming a Journeyman <b>Lineman</b>, it is helpful to have at least a two-year associate’s technical degree or certification from a trade school.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-hard-is-it-to-become-a-lineman></span>How hard is it to become a lineman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s a great career, and yes it is very <b>hard</b>. You must be both physically strong, pretty sharp mentally and willing to be uncomfortable for long periods of time. It doesn’t matter if it’s 12 degrees and sleeting, or 105 with 90% humidity, the job has to get done.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-worth-going-to-lineman-school></span>Is it worth going to lineman school?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Even when you make journeyman, it’s <b>going</b> to be several years before you are seasoned and have a good grasp on what is <b>going</b> on in every type of situation. So my advice, go to the best <b>lineman school</b> you can afford, because this is <b>going</b> to be the cornerstone of your career, as you move forward.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-lineman-a-dangerous-job></span>Is lineman a dangerous job?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Utility line <b>work</b> is in the top 10 of the most <b>dangerous jobs</b> in America. Around 30 to 50 workers in every 100, 000 are killed on the <b>job</b> every year. Many others suffer non-fatal loss of limbs from electrical burns and mechanical trauma. That’s more than twice the fatality rate of police officers and firemen.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-linemen-die-each-year></span>How many linemen die each year?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>According to NTOF data, the average <b>annual fatality</b> rate for power line workers is 56.3 <b>deaths per</b> 100,000 employees.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-linemen-make-good-money></span>Do linemen make good money?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An electrical <b>lineman’s</b> median annual income was $69,380 in May 2017, reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics; half <b>made</b> more, and half <b>made</b> less <b>money</b>. The bottom 10 percent of electrical <b>linemen made</b> under $37,600, while the top 10 percent earned very generous wages over $99,860.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-safest-job-in-the-world></span>What’s the safest job in the world?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th><b>World’s</b> most dangerous <b>jobs</b></th><th><b>World’s safest jobs</b></th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>1.</td><td>Construction labourer</td><td>Accountant/auditor</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>2.</td><td>Correction officer</td><td>Actuary</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>3.</td><td>Paramedic</td><td>Computer systems analyst</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>4.</td><td>Farmer</td><td>Dietician</td></tr></tbody></table>• Aug 11, 2016<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-job-has-most-deaths></span>What job has most deaths?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>But workers in the fishing and hunting industry <b>had</b> the highest mortality rates per 100,000 full-time workers, according to BLS, with 145 <b>deaths</b> per 100,000 people. They were followed by loggers, pilots and flight engineers and roofers.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-7-figures-salary></span>How much is 7 figures salary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>How <b>Much is 7 Figures</b>? Seven-<b>figure</b> incomes are anything over $1,000,000. Again, there is clearly a huge disparity between someone earning $1million and another at the top end of the <b>income</b> bracket earning $9million!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-lowest-paying-job></span>What is the lowest paying job?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There’s a reason why fast-food workers are so frequently at the center of debates over a living wage. With a median hourly wage of just over $10 an hour, the country’s 3.68 million food preparation and serving workers are America’s <b>lowest</b>-paid profession.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-30-000-a-year-a-good-salary></span>Is $30 000 a year a good salary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Is <b>$30000 a year good</b>? <b>$30,000 a year</b> is <b>good</b> for a single person, but it might be a stretch for a family unless it is one of multiple <b>income</b> streams. However, it can work depending on where you live and how you budget.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6o7HCqKSeZZFiuaq6xKaYp2WZo3qnuM6roJ2ZXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./garage-bands-recording-html.html><span>←</span><span>Garage band's recording</span></a>
