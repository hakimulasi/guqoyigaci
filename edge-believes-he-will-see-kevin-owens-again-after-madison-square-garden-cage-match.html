Many wrestlers missed the show due to positive tests or as precautionary measures against the virus.</p><p>The Day 1 pay-per-view is just days away. A positive COVID test could derail the entire show. The company made some changes to the non-televised event to protect the main eventers scheduled for the PPV.</p><p>That included an interesting matchup. Edge was plugged in for a cage match with Kevin Owens. Owens was supposed to take on WWE Champion Big E and Seth Rollins. They were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">held out</a> due to the virus. Edge said on his Instagram that it probably isn’t the last time the two will cross paths.</p><p>“Funny thing happened on my way to Detroit. I ended up in Madison Square Garden in a cage match against Kevin Owens. When I first got word I could wrestle again, this match was on my short list of things to do before I retire (for the last time). Have a feelin we’ll see each other again.”</p><p>Edge has recently been involved in a feud with The Miz and Maryse on Raw. He hasn’t wrestled a match since Crown Jewel. Seth Rollins was his opponent on that night.</p><p>Edge’s comeback made WWE fans think about a lot of the fresh matchups he might have in the future. Kevin Owens was at the top of his list. The two may wind up involved in their own main event feud in the near future.</p><p><strong>Would you like to see a feud between Edge and Kevin Owens?
