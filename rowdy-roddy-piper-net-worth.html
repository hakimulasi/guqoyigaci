Rowdy Roddy Piper shot to fame after appearing in the WWF and the WCW wrestling organizations. Despite his Canadian heritage, he was marketed as being Scottish.

Many critics believed that he was the greatest wrestling villain of all time.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Roddy Piper racked up 34 championships. He also started hosting his own WWE interview segment known as "Piper's Pit," which proved to be quite popular. By 2005, he had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, and during the induction, Rick Flair referred to him as the "most gifted entertainer in the history of professional wrestling."</p><p>Although he was a successful wrestler, Roddy also proved to be quite successful in a number of other film and television projects. His most famous role was probably in "They Live," in which he played the lead. Another notable role came in 1988 with "Hell Comes to Frogtown." He also made several appearances in the series "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Roderick George Toombs was born on April 17th of 1954 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

He then became Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and co-hosted "Prime Time Wrestling" alongside Gorilla Monsoon. After another hiatus, Roddy returned once more in 1994.
