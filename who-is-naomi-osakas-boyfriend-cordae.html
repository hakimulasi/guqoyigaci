We don’t really post intimate moments, because I feel as though they’re sacred. A relationship is really a sacred thing. Once you let outside influences get into it, it becomes less sacred.”</p><p>Osaka has revealed that Cordae, has gone out of his way to help and support her through her mental health struggle.</p><p>“During the whole New York thing [Osaka’s 2020 US Open protest mask] and with everything that was going on, I started to feel really depressed. Sometimes I would call Cordae, and maybe in some of the calls I would cry. I don’t remember. And he flew out, even though he was really busy. I really appreciated that. I’m not sure if I’ve told him that. I feel like he actually really helped me win just, like, keeping up the motivation.”</p><h2>Who is Cordae?</h2><p>Cordae Amari Dunston, is a Grammy-nominated rapper, singer and songwriter.</p><p>He shot to prominence through WorldStarHipHop’s YouTube channel who gave him a platform for his remixes of popular tracks.</p><p>Cordae dropped out of college after less than a year, admitting that he enrolled to please his mother.</p><p>While he was born in North Carolina, Cordae’s family moved to Maryland when he was young.</p><p>His first job was working at a local T.G.I. Friday’s.</p><p>In 2018, Cordae dedicated fresh focus to his rap career and eventually built a social media following that helped attract a record deal.</p><p>Atlantic records signed Cordae and have released his albums The Lost Boy and From a Birds Eye View.</p><p>Cordae has written lyrics about his girlfriend and she is flattered to be included in his art.</p><p>“It doesn’t cross my mind that often because he always asks permission,” Osaka told tennis.com. “But, yeah, I mean, I feel like that’s the most amazing part about it. He actually writes his lyrics. He has to take the time to actually experience the things that he does. It’s a really fascinating process.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=#>Naomi Osaka out of the Australian Open – is this the beginning of the end?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHNp6Csa2Zqe6S7zGirnqaensBuusSwqmivmKR6qr%2BMp5iopZlivLStypqqZpqfrrOztcSnm2abn6exorE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./july-2021-new-moon.html><span>←</span><span>What to Expect Based On Your Zodiac Sign</span></a>
