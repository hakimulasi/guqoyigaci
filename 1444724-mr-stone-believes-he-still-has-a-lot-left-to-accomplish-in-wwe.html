I’ve learned a lot throughout my career. Longevity in wrestling is hard. You need to stay on top of your game, constantly reinvent yourself, swallow your ego, and you need to be willing to put in the work and hustle.</p><p>“Still, to this day, I’m the biggest hustler there is. There is still a lot left I can accomplish. Look at Paul Heyman and MVP. They kept evolving, and they’re still integral parts of what we do. That’s what I want to continue to be.”</p><p><a href=#>Mr. Stone On His Current NXT Run: I’m Not Taking Any Of It For Granted</a></p><p>What do you make of Mr. Stone’s comments?
