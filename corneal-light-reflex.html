Due to this, the Hirschberg test is a routine part of childhood eye exams. It is also used to detect eye misalignment in adults.</p><h2>Corneal light reflex testing</h2><p>A corneal light reflex test, also known as the Hirschberg test, is a simple exam that checks for eye alignment by observing how light is reflected from the cornea of the eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>During the test, a patient centers their focus on a special light, and an eye doctor observes where the light is reflected. The corneal light reflex is normally centered on both pupils, but if it is not centered, an eye alignment disorder may be present.</p><p>For accurate results, it is important that the patient’s head is positioned straight and upright during the test (not tilted) and that both eyes are focused directly on the light.</p><p>While this process is helpful for identifying ocular alignment problems in children, it can also be used to detect underlying conditions in adults if their eyes appear to be misaligned.</p><h2>Why is the corneal light reflex important?</h2><p>If, during the Hirschberg test, the light reflex is not in the same position in each eye, it may be a sign of misalignment of the eyes. A person may compensate for this misalignment by tilting their head or squinting. While this is a temporary solution, it can contribute to worsening vision problems.</p><img data-zoomable src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.ctfassets.net/u4vv676b8z52/77QwtQ4fvycUgd4Gba4XJd/70f91900b54cc68fb361eac24f02075d/Types_of_Strabismus_compressed.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Corneal light reflex (Hirschberg) test: A screening test for strabismus that evaluates eye alignment based on the location of reflections of light shined at the eyes.</p><p>The earlier eye misalignment (strabismus) is detected through a corneal light reflex test, the sooner it can be corrected.
