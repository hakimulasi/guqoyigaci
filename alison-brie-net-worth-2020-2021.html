If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Alison Brie’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Born as Alison Brie Schermerhorn on December 1982, in Los Angeles, Alison Brie is a gorgeous American actress and musician. Her father, Charles Terry Schermerhorn, was a musician and entertainment reporter while her mother, Joanne Brenner, was a worker in an NGO. She had the Christian father and Jewish mother, but it didn’t affect her upbringing. Her parents even separated after a few years of her birth, but they equally gave love and care to Alison.</p><p>Alison was passionate to become an actress since her childhood, so she also joined the Jewish Community Centre along with her school and started performing in the stage theatres. After completing her high school from ‘South Pasadena High School’, she moved to California Institute of the Arts. She graduated from here with a bachelor degree in theatre. To excel in her music skills, she also attended the ‘Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama’ in Scotland.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Talking about her personal life, Alison is a faithful lover. She married actor Dave Franco in 2017 after dating for a long time. Prior to her, she hasn’t been reportedly linked with any other actor or celebrity.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 29 December 1982, Alison Brie is 41 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. Her height is 1.6 m tall, and her weight is 50 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Alison grew up watching her father as a musician. Maybe, this was the reason that she also wanted to build her career in the glamour world. It was not easy for Alison to get the ball rolling. She had learned acting since childhood, but after graduation, she had to look for the work.</p><p>In fact, she worked as a clown at birthday parties before her talents got noticed in 2004 when she landed a role in the short movie ‘Stolen Poem’. She made her first appearance on the big screen in 2006 with the TV show ‘Hannah Montana’. Though she appeared only in a few episodes, she grabbed many eyeballs.</p><p>Her actual career began after 2007 when she bagged lead roles in two TV series simultaneously. She first tested the success with the TV series ‘Mad Man’ which lasted from 2007-2015. At the same time, she also appeared as Annie Edison in the TV ‘Community’ (2009-15).</p><p>With these TV series, she rose into fame and established herself as a skilled actress in the industry. Though she had success as a TV actress, she also appeared in a number of films such as Raspberry Magic, Scream 4, BoJack Houseman and No Stranger than Love. Lately, in 2017, the ravishing actress is starred as Ruth Wilder on the Netflix series ‘Glow’.</p><h2>Awards & achievements</h2><p>In the real sense, Alison entered in Hollywood in 2008, and just less than ten years, she has won many nominations, awards, and achievements. She has won 2 ‘Behind the Voice Actors Awards’, ‘IGN Summer Movie Award’, ‘Screen Actors Guild Award’, ‘TV Guide Award’ and several other nominations.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Alison Brie in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Alison-Brie-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As we said above, Alison is quite young and has been around for a while only; you can’t expect a whopping net worth under her name. But in her just 10-year-long career, she has really made a great deal of money. As of July 2024, the charming actress holds a sizeable net worth of $12 million.</p><p>Some celebrities are unable to make this much amount, even in their entire career. The major source of her earning is, of course, acting. Those two TV series that last for almost 8-9 years have really made a huge amount for her. As Alison is at the peak of her career, her net worth will surely increase in the coming years.</p><p>The lady, who has been ranked as one of the most beautiful faces around the world by ‘The Annual Independent Critics’, has recently created an uproar with her slaying looks and startling acting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZK6ttdKopWaaop6ybrrErWSwp6KptW5%2Bj2tnZmpgZ35w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./al-roker-ex-wife-meet-alice-bell.html><span>←</span><span>Al Roker Ex-Wife: Meet Alice Bell</span></a>
