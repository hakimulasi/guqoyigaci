The Batman v Superman actor, who turned 43 on Saturday, Aug. 15, is celebrating the momentous occasion in Orlando with estranged wife <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong> and their three children, a source tells <strong>Us Weekly</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Affleck flew into Atlanta, Ga., ahead of his birthday weekend on Thursday, Aug. 13. Garner, 43, has been staying there with their kids <strong>Violet</strong>, 9, <strong>Seraphina</strong>, 6, and <strong>Samuel</strong>, 3, while she films Miracles From Heaven.&nbsp;</p><p>On Saturday, the family packed up for Orlando, Fla., where they hit up Universal Studios shortly after arriving. They were joined by Affleck's mom, Christine.</p><p>The estranged couple, who announced the end of their 10-year marriage in late June, have been putting up a united front for their kids in recent days, despite ongoing drama surrounding Affleck's romance with their former nanny <strong>Christine Ouzounian</strong>, as revealed exclusively by <strong>Us </strong>last month. (A rep for the actor has denied "all allegations of a romantic relationship" as "baseless and untrue.")</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"They feel like they have to be mature adults for their children's sake and that they will figure out the healthiest way to co-parent," an insider previously told <strong>Us</strong> of the exes. "They want the kids' lives to stay the same and to not have to change just because they aren't going to be married anymore."</p><p>Aside from outings with his family, Affleck has kept a relatively low profile since the scandal broke — though he did walk the red carpet with BFF <strong>Matt Damon</strong> at the Aug. 10 world premiere of The Leisure Class, a Project Greenlight revival.</p><p>"He's got a big smile on his face tonight," Damon told reporters of his pal, who posed briefly for photos but declined interviews. Of Affleck's then-impending birthday, the Interstellar actor, 44, added, "I wish him well, you know, but he's 43. It's not 40. It's not 45…You know, it's a forgettable birthday. I don't even remember my 43rd birthday!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmepl2Ws6e4xJyiZqKVo7uqssSrZKCZoqOys3nTmqKeZZuesbR506hkqKqclrulu4yopWagmah6o7XRrZ%2Bdmalif3F9lGpscQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yale-fentanyl-scandal-nurse-admits-to-tampering-with-medication.html><span>←</span><span>Yale Fentanyl Scandal: Nurse Admits to Tampering With Medication</span></a>
