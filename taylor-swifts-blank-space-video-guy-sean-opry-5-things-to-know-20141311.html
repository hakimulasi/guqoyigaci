(Among other things, she stabs a cake, slashes the portrait she painted of him, takes an axe to the tree where she carved their names, and smashes his car with a golf club.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Swift wasn’t the only one who went crazy over him, though. After the video premiered on Monday, Nov. 10, O’Pry was everyone’s new crush — including ours! Below, check out five things to know about the sexy new star.</p><p><strong>1. He was discovered on MySpace.</strong></p><p><a href=#>ForbesLife</a> estimated in October 2013 that O’Pry made $1.5 million in 2012, making him “the most successful male model in the world.” His career has included campaigns with Giorgio Armani, Versace, H&M, Zara, and Hugo Boss, among others — and it all started, he told the mag, because a couple of top industry folks (including former America’s Next Top Model judge Nole Marin) discovered him on MySpace when he was 17 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>2. He auditioned to be Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie.</strong></p><p>“I read for it,” the aspiring actor told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> of the role of the S&M-loving billionaire, which went first to <strong>Charlie Hunnam</strong> and then to <strong>Jamie Dornan</strong>. Asked why he didn’t get it, given his undeniable good looks, he replied, “I think it was more the acting ability at the time.”</p><p>That’s something he hopes to improve upon in the future. “I’m in school for acting,” he told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. “I want to be well-accepted as an actor, not just [as] a prop…Doing this video really motivated me further.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>3. He’s a country music fan.</strong></p><p>“I am from Georgia, and <strong><a href=#>Tim McGraw</a></strong> is my favorite artist,” O’Pry told <a href=#>VF</a> of whether he knew Swift’s music before he starred in her video. “And when this little girl released ‘Tim McGraw,’ yeah, I had teardrops on my guitar, not going to lie about that.” (Both “Tim McGraw” and “Teardrops on My Guitar” are songs from the “Shake It Off” singer’s 2006 debut album.)&nbsp;</p><p>He’s also a fan of her new, pop-y stuff. “The album is phenomenal,” he gushed of 1989. “You can listen to it from the first song to the last.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>4. “Blank Space” is not his first music video.</strong></p><p>Back in 2012, O’Pry appeared alongside a number of other male models — including Simon Nessman, Jon Kortajarena, and Rob Evans, according to <a href=#>NY Mag</a> — in a sexy clip for none other than the Queen of Pop, <strong><a href=#>Madonna</a></strong>. He and his fellow hunks showed off their hot bods (and more!) in Madge’s homoerotic vid for “Girl Gone Wild.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>5. He restores cars in his spare time.</strong></p><p>“[When I was] a kid, my grandfather had a beautiful mint green and white 1951 [Ford] F-100,” he told <a href=#>Forbes</a> in 2013. “And I grew up looking at this truck. And there was just something about it.”&nbsp;</p><p>He was young at the time, though, so he never pursued cars as a hobby until much later in life. “When I finally did get something in my pocket, I started collecting,” he told Forbes. “My first car was a 1973 [Ford] Bronco, and then soon after that — not even a couple months [later] — I got a 1970 [Chevrolet] Chevelle.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrrGWSoa6vt4ysp5qblWLDqrDEqGSgraliwKatzWamqaqpYoJuwMeipaCrXam8brfNqK5mamBmgXJ%2FkGo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shiloh-jolie-pitt-vs-suri-cruise-2012245.html><span>←</span><span>Shiloh Jolie-Pitt vs. Suri Cruise</span></a>
