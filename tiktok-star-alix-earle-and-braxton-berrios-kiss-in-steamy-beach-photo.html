“Hbd nfl man 🥳,” Earle, 22, wrote via Instagram on Friday, October 6, alongside a pic of the pair kissing on a beach.
In the snap, Berrios — wearing striped swim trunks — hoisted Earl up in his arms and pulled her in for a steamy smooch. Earle, who wrapped her arms and legs around the NFL star, wore a black bikini and tied her long blonde locks in a low ponytail."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It was a good relationship, it was a healthy one and towards the end of it we had conversations along the lines of ‘we weren’t working out.’ So, when we split back in January, that’s why.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZupvKx50q2Yq2WRoba5ecSaqaWdXZa7pXnBq5ixrJ%2BjeqOx0augqKtdoLa0v4yipWarpJqursWMm5yam5hivam706hm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-queen-does-not-want-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-to-raise-their-baby-vegan-267656.html><span>←</span><span>The Queen Does Not Want Prince Harry And Meghan Markle To Raise Their Baby Vegan</span></a>
