"There had been a lot of musicians in the line-up but when I said I'd met her, she did show some recognition. It was very quick then and I got to speak to her for longer this time, which was lovely. I told her that I have two children at the school and she also asked about the percussion rooms. She was so warm and so interested."</p><p id=eRMw26diuOOa data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Holly Willoughby shares rare glimpse inside son Chester's room - look at all those toys!</a></strong></p><p id=eJthEaiZlpZn data-wc=75>The Queen was given a tour of the music facility by headmaster Ian Wilmshurst. In one room, Sam Innes, 18, in the upper sixth, was with his piano teacher. "My piano teacher said to give it [the piano] a cheeky play, and the Queen said, 'oh do.' I played some Chopin.

Adam Barrett-James, 15, who is in fifth form, recalled: "She asked who was playing, and I told her it was the computer playing the music. She quite liked it! Meeting her was a moment I will never forget." In the recital hall, Her Majesty also listened to the choir singing King of Glory, King of Peace and Magnifat.</p><p id=eeN6qYjd5JGd data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess Kate wants her son Prince George to sign up to Scouts</a></strong></p><p id=e-4Ld-XQ8rd_ data-wc=58>Before leaving, the monarch unveiled a plaque and signed a visitors book.
