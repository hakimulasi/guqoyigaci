It never defined who I was. I was so young at the time — 17 — that I hadn’t developed myself independently or professionally,” she told Buster & Ellie in 2013. “I got my senior year on tape, which I think is pretty special to show my kids someday. Who knows? They will probably be embarrassed by it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Three years later, the designer <a href=#>reunited with some of her former costars</a> for an E!
