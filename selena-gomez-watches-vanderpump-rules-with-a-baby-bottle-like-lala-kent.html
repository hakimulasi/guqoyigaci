The SUR hostess revealed that her “bubba,” which is filled with warm milk and honey, “soothes” her when she struggles with anxiety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lala-kent1.jpg><p>“I started when I was first put on my anti-anxiety meds — I’m on a very small dose of anything that my doctor has given me, because I don’t prefer meds,” Kent told <a href=#>The Cut</a> in April about her now infamous bottle. “You know, there are a lot of people who say if you put an elastic band around your wrist, and your anxiety is out of control, you can flick it against your wrist. For me it was like … having something in my mouth makes me fall asleep. And, obviously, if I have something to suck on I don’t want to choke and die … So a baby bottle was just the next thing. I’d watch babies do it and it’s so soothing for them.”</p><p>“I just call down to room service and ask them for warm milk and honey, and they always think I’m a weirdo,” she continued. “Then I just make the bottle in my room and call it a night. Turn on some&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;or&nbsp;Family Guy and suck on my bubba.”</p><p>The “Boy” singer shared the photo of Gomez and Collins on her Instagram Story on Wednesday, May 23, writing “shoutout to @selenagomez and @annaballins.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While it may be news that&nbsp;Gomez is a fan of Vanderpump Rules, other stars, including Teigen, <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> </a>have<a href=#> expressed their love</a> for the reality series over the years.</p><p>Vanderpump Rules: Secrets Revealed airs on Bravo Monday, May 28, at 9 p.m. ET.
