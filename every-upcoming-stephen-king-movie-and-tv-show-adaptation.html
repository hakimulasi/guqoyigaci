Not much else is known about the project, but some Salem’s Lot fans are hoping for more info ASAP.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Welcome to Derry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pennywise.png><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Welcome to Derry</a> is an upcoming prequel series to Stephen King’s It.
