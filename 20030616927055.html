"But whatever happens, you grow from your experience… At the moment my situation is that me and Jude are best friends."</p><p id=e6dUgBQ3tyz- data-wc=86>The mother-of-four – who suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of her youngest child, six-month-old Rudy – has hired a nanny to help care for her four children and relies greatly on her family for emotional support. "I think maybe it put me under a lot of stress having the babies so close together," she says. "I don't know how I've managed to keep myself together and get on top of it all." She continues: "The children need to be my priority at the moment."</p><p id=emlq8eYkhC1V data-wc=47>It was apparently the children's nanny who called police to investigate an assault at Jude and Sadie's home one morning last week. However, Scotland Yard found no evidence that the Frost French designer had been hurt, and she also declined to file a complaint against her husband.</p><p id=e1sQp6DNbrHj data-wc=24>Members of Sadie's family have since played down the headline-making row, with her father stating the incident had been "blown out of all proportion".</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
