According to Sports Business Journal, WWE and NFL have signed a multiyear licensing deal to create NFL-inspired WWE legacy title belts.</p><p>The deal includes the title belts and will feature the official colors and branding of all 32 teams. These officially licensed NFL products will be launching today on <a href=#>NFLShop.com</a>, <a href=#>WWEShop.com</a> and Fanatics.com.</p><p>This also marks the first time WWE and NFL have a licensing agreement. This is their latest licensing agreement, as the company have already signed one with MLB back in 2021 and last year they secured licenses to produce custom side plates for all 14 SEC schools. We’ll have to see whether the legacy belts will sell out like hotcakes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Do you think the NFL legacy belts will be a hot commodity online?
