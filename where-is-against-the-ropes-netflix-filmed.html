It's also one of the most populous neighborhoods, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Mexico</a> reporting that some 1.8 million people lived there in 2020.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Scarlet Gruber (@scarlet_gruber)</a></p></figure><p>In the world of entertainment, Iztapalapa is the home of Mexico City's annual Passion Play, with the Easter pageant attracting an audience of some 2 million spectators.</p><p>The borough also hosts the Festival del Fuego Nuevo (New Fire Festival) in November/December. The festival celebrates Mexican culture in both its past and present forms, from traditions of the ancient Mexicans to modern Mexican cinema.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'Against the Ropes' wrestling scenes were filmed at Mexico's Arena Naucalpan.</h2><p>A series centered on wrestling needs an impressive arena, and further <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> posts by director Mao Medina reveal that Against the Ropes shot its wrestling scenes at Arena Naucalpan. As its name indicates, it's an indoor sports arena located in Naucalpan de Juárez, which is northwest of Mexico City.</p><p>The venue has plenty of lucha libre history as it's specifically configured for wrestling events. The ring seen in Against the Ropes is permanently in the center of the arena.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mao Medina (@emeaoh)</a></p></figure><p>Arena Naucalpan has been the home of Mexico's International Wrestling Revolution Group since 1996, but has hosted other promotions since it opened its doors back in 1977.</p><p>The venue seats 2,400 spectators, which makes it very small compared to most U.S. arenas. However, that likely makes it great to film a TV series like Against the Ropes, since the small space makes it easier for cameras to be up close to the wrestling action.</p><p>While the Netflix series is gaining fans for its family-oriented story, it's also doing a fine job of showing viewers the Mexico City area and some of its more memorable locations.</p><p>Against the Ropes is streaming now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkZyuqrrSrWStoJViv7C8xKxkp52km7mqxIyfoKWllZk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1444724-mr-stone-believes-he-still-has-a-lot-left-to-accomplish-in-wwe.html><span>←</span><span>Mr. Stone Believes He Still Has A Lot Left To Accomplish In WWE</span></a>
