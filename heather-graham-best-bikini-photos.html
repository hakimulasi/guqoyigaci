I try to get a lot of sleep. Beyond that, I think just being happy on the inside and whatever. I do all the self-help stuff: I meditate, I do yoga, I work through all the stuff in therapy, then do all the different kinds of sorting through my inner world to make myself feel happy on the inside."</p><p id=e-qzH_xd-hk data-wc=38>Revealing just how much sleep she aims for each night, she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> in 2016: "<strong>When I tell people how much I sleep sometimes, they are horrified.

She favors a triangle cup and high-leg bottoms that help to accentuate her features. Her most recent bikini photo was shared in August 2023 during a vacation in Greece. She looked phenomenal in a vivid red two-piece, which highlighted her slim physique and long, toned legs.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>2</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/77311f03c35b-heather-graham-white-bikini.jpg><p id=eAFyYtFykUk1>During the same vacation, Heather modeled a white bikini while soaking up the sun on a pebble beach. Rocking wet hair and dark sunglasses, she showcased her yoga-honed figure while stretching her arms up underneath an umbrella.</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>3</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e75dbc256222-heather-graham-black-bikini.jpg><p id=eLcMRVNB9cyH>Heather is clearly a fan of Greece as she vacationed there in July 2021 also. Basking under the hot sun, she chose another plain bikini, this time in black as she floated on the water in a giant pink flamingo.</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>4</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43b0e42a9245-heather-graham-tiny-bikini.jpg><p id=eFmG72WCQ6_8>In January 2021, the actress temporarily switched up her love of plain colors for a bold leopard print bikini. She also opted for a balconette style which gave her more of a lift. With the sun shining down on her tanned skin, Heather once again looked sensational while enjoying some "ocean meditation".</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>5</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d0fcf8561308-heather-graham-bikini-photo.jpg><p id=eE7AIwNDobnB>&nbsp;In August 2020, she shared the above photo of herself in a green two-piece while chilling out on a beach after "a crazy year".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWiblaGyo77IrbBmq6SuuaZ7lGlnbXBkZLWmrdOhnKtll6euqa3MZpmeq6Rir6q3yKegZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-reed.html><span>←</span><span>Golf's Captain America, Patrick Reed is a professional golfer!</span></a>
