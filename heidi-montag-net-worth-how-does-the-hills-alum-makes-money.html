As part of this effort, I reinvested in my fitness routine, as you’ve probably noticed on my socials.”</p><p>Heidi continued, “And, perhaps the biggest challenge as a mom of two young children, made a conscious effort to eat a well-rounded diet. This all paid off when I stepped on the scale in late October down 22 pounds! If you’re willing to put in the effort, Hydroxycut works! It certainly did for me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJon56hlJ56rrvNrZigZZ6awW7DzquroWWYpMRusM6eqmasmJp6qbXLpapmmZyqum65wKScrGWdpLumxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-longoria-jokes-she-was-hung-up-on-showing-skin-in-early-2000s.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Longoria Jokes She Was 'Hung Up' on Showing Skin in Early 2000s</span></a>
