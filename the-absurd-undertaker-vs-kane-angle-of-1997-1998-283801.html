Yet looked like a guy who just got out of Golds Gym, with his 80s rocker hair. Jake the Snake had some connection with a snake, and there are plenty of crazy gimmicks that are absurd. In fact most wrestling gimmicks are absurd.</p><p>The Kane vs Taker feud did not happen over 2-3 months leading up to Mania, it was slowly developed for a year, and even had traces before that. That is why it is so memorable to so many people, its something they watched develop for a long period of time. Bearer, a rambling madman, sort like a Frankenstein had a card up his sleeve, and would over a long period of time reveal more and more information about this Kane.</p><p>Not only did they get a new top talent, a hot feud, but they also got out of the HBK vs Taker match without anyone really winning. However they did not have Kane instantly put on Raw to have wrestling matches with wrestlers, they kept his mystique going by him simply destroying random people. He was a force.</p><p>If Kane was done today, he would be teased for 3 weeks with nice clean looking promos, then come out and destroy R Truth, then he would give the win back to R Truth on Smackdown before finally beating him at Fast and The Furious PPV in a 20 min back and forth match, during the match JBL and Michael Cole would make fun of a "grown man who still thinks its Halloween". Next night on Raw, he would wear a pink attire to show that he wants to fight breastcancer and challenge John Cena to a match, who would make fun of Kane and his "id be mad too if my weiner was burned to ashes", this would get Cole and King to force laugh at this stupid line and would make Kane rage in the ring, before he comically trips and falls over in the ring, to great amusement of everyone. WWE: Then, Now, Forever.</p><p>The mid and late 90s were a crazy period for wrestling, with plenty of hotshotting and what not, but there were still traces of the old philosophies of how to build a feud, and Kane vs Taker: The Original was a great one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnpJ2ybq3BrKyrnF2qu6Wx0a2YpJ2iYsO0ecqapZ5lkaO0rbGMqJ1maWluhG59mHJvZ2poaIVxfY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snooki-dry-humps-jersey-shore-costars-in-white-bunny-costume-201222.html><span>←</span><span>Snooki Dry Humps Jersey Shore Costars in White Bunny Costume</span></a>
