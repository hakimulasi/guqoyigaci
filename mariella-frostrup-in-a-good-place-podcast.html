I’m at home, in my flat in London, where I spend a small amount of time – mostly I live in Somerset. And it’s always quite nice, I think, to be in the city for brief periods.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5HB-mjJaY data-wc=8><a class=hm-link href=#>SUBSCRIBE TO THE IN A GOOD PLACE NEWSLETTER</a></p><p id=eK6iSek_C2S data-wc=44>"But I’m always very grateful for the fact that we moved to Somerset 11 years ago, because that’s definitely my good place. I just get off the train, take a big, deep breath and I just get oxygen all the way through the body.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoDiQ3AyYkI data-wc=22>“Some days are better than others. Today’s a good day apart from the over-crammed tube.

It symbolises happiness and contentment, which I think are two of the hardest things to come by in the rather frenetic world that we live in now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bac69a0a833b-shutterstockeditorial13632500br.jpg><p id=eFk__NzJEtf9 data-wc=12><strong>Why did you decide to open up your life in your book?</strong></p><p id=e__UdPwibSqQ data-wc=39>“I’ve always been quite vocal about whatever’s preoccupying me. You know, I’m the eldest of five. I left home and school quite young. I’ve always fended for myself. So I’m probably more outspoken than a person needs to be.</p><p id=e3NgCN0R3uIW data-wc=96>“With the menopause, I was just completely gobsmacked. I spent two years feeling really quite dreadful, anxious, not in a good place, not sleeping, and really feeling like I was slightly going out of my mind and no real idea why… they seemed really indiscriminate symptoms. And it took me a couple of years to finally get to see a gynaecologist, who was just fantastic, and said: ‘Look, I’ve talked to you for five minutes, you’re definitely going through menopause. And what you need is some hormones, and let’s check your bone density,’ and so on.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePZYIUjkCivv data-wc=87>“The thing I was so shocked about, though, was that I consider myself someone who’s lived through all kinds of different challenges. And yet, this was one that was not only very, very difficult, but was made even more so by the fact it seemed like it was completely unmentionable. I couldn’t believe that, and it felt incredibly unjust, and like yet another hurdle thrown in women’s paths that you really need like a hole in the head when you finally get to your 40s or 50s.&nbsp;</p><p id=elbTyD3LaX3t data-wc=9><strong>&nbsp;RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Katie Piper: 'Simplicity is key to my happiness'</a></strong></p><p id=eF7vN0lHAksf data-wc=27>"And I thought: ‘I refuse to be ashamed; why should I be ashamed of something that’s completely natural, that happens to 50 per cent of the population?’”&nbsp;</p><p id=eYTc4WToC3Az data-wc=5><strong>Do you lean into self-compassion?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=esbbCuYH8W0G data-wc=51>“When I’m feeling really rubbish, I’m really nice to myself. If I feel like getting into bed and listening to sad songs, or just like devouring a box set and hiding from the world, then I’ll do it because ultimately, at the end of it, you do come out feeling better.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/705e75626b18-shutterstockeditorial13722509bt.jpg><p id=e6yRL4JE8PIF data-wc=12>“You can’t be sad forever, just like you can’t be happy forever.”</p><p id=eikm6PbAnZMI data-wc=15><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Giovanna Fletcher on coping with mum-overwhelm – and why she loves the school run</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e1nRJQqQ0ANW data-wc=6><strong>Does the ageing process bother you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=esM1-XCwnuNm data-wc=67>“Yeah, it bothers me because it’s hard to deny that time is passing. And you can see the visual manifestation of it and you feel a bit of nostalgia and a little bit of mourning, perhaps, for youth. I look at my kids and their friends and I just marvel at how perfect they are, which makes it all the more frustrating that they don’t realise it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eZntS4dKzj data-wc=13><strong>MORE FROM ROSIE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Rochelle Humes opens up about mum-guilt: 'I'm so far removed'</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eZdiZdnLTVuu data-wc=9><strong>What’s the best piece of advice you’ve been given?</strong></p><p id=eUTf3NJrsnCN data-wc=37>“I used to travel a lot to Africa – I still do when I get a chance, because I’ve worked with a lot of different NGOs, with Oxfam and now I’m an ambassador for Save the Children.</p><p id=eOOa_3c9e51c data-wc=44>“And I think African women are amazing.
