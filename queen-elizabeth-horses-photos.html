In 2014, in fact, the beloved monarch, who has been riding horses for most of her nine decades, was presented with the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) Lifetime Achievement Award for her dedication to the sport. "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is a life-long lover of horses who has inspired millions around the world," said FEI President Princess Haya of Jordan. "She is a true horsewoman, who still rides whenever state business allows, and her knowledge of breeding and bloodlines is incredible." In honor one of the world's most dedicated royal equestrians, HELLO! takes a look back at her passion for ponies.</b>Now in her 90s, Her Majesty had her first riding lesson at the age of three and was given her first pony, a Shetland mare, by her grandfather King George V when she turned four.
