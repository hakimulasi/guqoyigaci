<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>A dancer saves Beyonce after boob pops out in the middle of a concert</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Beyonce</strong> is slaying all over the world with her 'Renaissance World Tour', which now has her visiting cities all over Europe. A couple of weeks ago she was in <strong>Barcelona</strong>, in the Olympic Stadium, where she hadn't sung for seven years.</p><p>The Texan stopped on Wednesday in <strong>Germany</strong>, specifically in Hamburg, where she delighted her fans with her choreographies, her music and her performance on stage.</p><p>In this last concert held in Germany, the artist suffered a mishap that almost embarrassed her. It happened in the middle of the concert, with <strong>Beyonce </strong>singing the song 'Break my soul', in this part of the concert she was wearing a very tight pink dress, with clear cleavage on display.</p><p>Beyonce's dancer's quick intervention</p><p>At one point in the song, her left breast was about to pop out, but one of the dancers who was standing next to her at the time noticed and prevented it from popping out completely live on stage.</p><p>The dancer grabbed <strong>Beyonce</strong>'s hand, stood in front of the artist and between the two of them they positioned the cleavage so that the singer didn't have a hard time. They did it in a subtle way, it even looked like part of the choreography. And best of all, they did it without the show stopping, although the artist was surprised by this unexpected move.</p><p>Even so, fans at the concert captured the moment, which has not gone unnoticed on social media, where the video has gone viral. Fans have hailed the dancer's quick intervention.</p><p>Specifically, the dancer who helped her is one of the twins who went viral dancing on TikTok with their impressive choreography, they are known on the social network as Les Twins and their names are <strong>Larry and Laurent Bourgeois</strong>.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Beyonce's nightmare moment: Breast pops out during concert</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>TikTok</span></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mrKyhk2R%2FcX6SaGdvZ2JqfHeAmHFsn5liZ4N5sZKemXFtlG2vdYGXcWWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-movies-has-nikki-glaser-been-in.html><span>←</span><span>What movies has Nikki Glaser been in?</span></a>
