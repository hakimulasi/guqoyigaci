She has said in the past that she wished there was a cure for mental illness so she could be happy, and in an upcoming episode she is in tears when she tells her therapist that her mental health issues feel “like a ticking bomb.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>#AndrewGlennon</a> "seems more concerned with public perception than getting back together with" <a href=# rel=nofollow>@AmberLPortwood</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TeenMomOG</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/qaYCSwnCSC</a></p><p>— Perez Hilton (@PerezHilton) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 8, 2019</a></p><p>According to Radar Online, Portwood is now facing one count of <a href=#>domestic battery</a>, a felony count of criminal recklessness with a deadly weapon, and a felony count of domestic battery after allegedly attacking Glennon when they got into an argument about the traffic during a 4th of July fireworks event.</p><p>The Affidavit for Probable Cause reveals that Portwood got mad at Glennon and made him feel like he “dropped the ball” when they couldn’t navigate through the heavy traffic. And, when they got home she became irate and threw a shoe at his head before picking up the machete, which she keeps in the house for protection.</p><p>Glennon locked himself and their 14-month-old son, James, in the bathroom to get away from Portwood, and she allegedly “hit the door with the machete and kicked the door and broke the handle.”</p><p>Just a few short days after the incident, Glennon filed a Combined Verified Petition for Paternity Related Orders and Emergency Hearing Regarding Custody of a Child. Glennon wants primary custody of James, as well as child support, and he also wants Portwood to pay for medical expenses and insurance.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Exclusive: The <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TeenMomOG</a> star and Andrew Glennon have not spoken. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/6ForbANceG</a></p><p>— Us Weekly (@usweekly) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 8, 2019</a></p><p>Initially, there was a no-contact order in place, so Portwood was not allowed to see James.
