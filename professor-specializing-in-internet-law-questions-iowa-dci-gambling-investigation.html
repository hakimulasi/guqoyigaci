That data would be used in law enforcement investigations. The upside is that less innocent bystanders would be investigated.</p><p>“Google has historically stored location, history information for all of us in a giant database,” said Bambauer. “Law-enforcement, they have been able to get access to that material with a warrant issued.”</p><p>Bambauer said he believes Google is cutting back due to the amount of time it takes to fill all of the law enforcement requests.</p><p>“If you’re using a digital device, you leave a breadcrumb with everything that we do online,” said Bambauer. “I think that we have these super-computers in our pockets, we’re also just giving off all this information about what we’re doing, where we are, all sorts of things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46sq5qslWK7psPSaKCor5Fiu6bD0minq6eWmsC0u9Fmqqmdk56urbXZoqWgZZmjeqq6056pp52kYrmiw4yqrJ6rpJ68r7%2BMoqawmV2ZsKp5xpqkm6SZo7Rutc2vnKysmZyutbXOp2Z4pqiovaK%2BwKZ0ag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksanas-baby.html><span>←</span><span>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</span></a>
