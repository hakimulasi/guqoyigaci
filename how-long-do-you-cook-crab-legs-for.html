The smell of ammonia is a <b>byproduct of the decomposition of seafood</b>. Your fishmonger probably sold you a crab that has gone bad. To avoid getting sick, do not eat crabs, or any type of seafood, that smell like ammonia.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-do-u-boil-snow-crab></span>How long do u boil snow crab?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Crab legs only need to boil for <b>about 5 minutes</b>.
