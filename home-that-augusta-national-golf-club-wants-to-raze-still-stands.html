But one hold-out house has remained the topic of conversation.</p><p>Located at 1112 Stanley Road, one Georgia family has refused to sell for decades, turning down millions of dollars in the name of family legacy.</p><p>In the last decade, an entire neighborhood in the city of Augusta — that once stood across from the golf club —&nbsp; has now been turned into a free parking lot. The club spent more than $40 million to bulldoze it.</p><p>The home was built by Herman and Elizabeth Thacker in 1959. They raised their children and grandchildren inside.</p><p>And it looks like the house is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p><p>“Mom is still living, she’s 91,” their daughter, Robin(Bobby) Rinder told The Post. “The home is still there and will continue to be.”</p><p>In a 2016 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with NJ.com</a>, the two revealed that their 1,900-square-foot home is where they hoped to live out their final days.</p><p>“We really don’t want to go,” Elizabeth said at the time.</p><p>“Money ain’t everything,” Herman added.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Herman and Elizabeth Thacker in front of their home in Augusta, Georgia in April 2016. <span class=credit>@talkinggolf</span></figure><p>And, indeed, it seems Herman took his final breaths in the home where he lived for more than 65 years.</p><p>Herman, an avid golf fan himself, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away in 2019</a> at 86 years old. His wife of 64 years remains in the home today.</p><p>Once a year, their home is surrounded by cars for the big golf spectacle, which has taken place since 1934.</p><p>Whenever a representative from Augusta National stopped by to make an offer, up to $1 million, the two always invited him inside.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The proximity of the Thacker house to the August National Golf Club. <span class=credit>Google Maps</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Herman and Elizabeth Thacker built the home back in 1959. <span class=credit>Google Maps</span></figure><p>“He’ll come by here every so often and he’ll say, ‘Just want to let you know we’re still interested in your property,'” Herman said at the time. “And we’ll tell him the same thing again.”</p><p>The house is estimated to be worth $360,000 today, according to a Zillow estimate.</p><p>Their family has since expanded to include five great-grandchildren. When the holidays come, they still find a way to pack everybody inside.</p><p>One of their grandchildren is now a professional golfer and is a PGA Tour member. Scott Brown has yet to qualify for the Masters.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Thackers owned a smaller house across the street that they did eventually sell for $1.2 million.</p><p>“They called us over there the first time and made us an offer,” the late Herman previously said. “I asked him, ‘Is that your bottom line?”‘ He said, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Well, we’ll see you then,’ and we got up and walked out. It wasn’t long before he was calling back over here, wanting to know if he could come talk to us again.”</p><p>After the sale closed, the house — and everything in it — were gone within a week.</p><p>The Post has reached out to the North August Chamber of Commerce, which oversees the tournament, for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mampfnbyusYytn5qsXZbCqMHSrZhmppGptrC6wKVkoKecm3qkuNSbZLCZnqnAbsDOZqmaspViwLW1y6VkrKyRo7G0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harry-potter-actor-matthew-lewis-marries.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Potter star Matthew Lewis marries Angela Jones in stunning Italian setting</span></a>
