<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>'Vanderpump Rules' Finale Recap: Stassi Upsets Lisa at Party</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>The claws are out! <b>James Kennedy </b>and <b>Jax Taylor</b> got into a heated argument — while&nbsp;<b>Lala Kent</b> shoved <b>Kristen Doute</b>&nbsp;— during<b> Katie Maloney</b> and <b>Tom Schwartz</b>’s engagement party&nbsp;</span><span>in the season 4 finale of Bravo’s&nbsp;<i>Vanderpump Rules</i> on Monday, March 14.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Stassi Schroeder</b><span> and Kristen crashed the party at</span><i> </i><b>Lisa Vanderpump</b><span>’s house, and naturally, the </span><i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills s</i><span>tar wanted nothing to do with them.</span></p><p><b>Jax Is a Free Man</b></p><p>Jax arrived back from court in Hawaii a free man after his felony charge for stealing was completely wiped off of his record, and he was put on probation. However, he was not exactly excited to be back, considering he was sleep-deprived and annoyed with having to live with <b>Brittany Cartwright</b> in a tiny apartment. “I can’t escape you,” he said to his girlfriend.&nbsp;<span>He also said jail finally gave him some “peace and quiet.” Yikes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Plus, Jax couldn’t catch a break with Lisa, who accused him of “minimizing” his felony. “Although Jax is getting older, he’s not actually growing up,” Lisa said to the camera. Double yikes.</span></p><p><b>Kristen and Stassi Crash the Party</b></p><p>In last week’s episode, Lisa was very adamant about not letting Kristen and Stassi into her home (well technically, her backyard) for Katie’s party. However, nothing could stop Kristen from supporting her friend, and Stassi was just along for the ride.&nbsp;</p><p>“The only thing holding me back right is that I have self-respect and dignity,” Stassi said to the camera, but thank goodness Kristen wasn’t preoccupied with those qualities and just wanted to party. Everyone was shocked, especially Lisa, who quipped, “Clearly, just two gates isn’t enough [to keep them out].”</p><p><b>Jax and Stassi Reunite</b></p><p>“Damn, she looks good,” Jax said when he saw Stassi walk into the party. It was no surprise that it would be awkward when the two finally reunited, but Stassi chose to talk cordially to Brittany before approaching Jax.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“I see similarities between me and Brittany — she seems so nice. I don’t want Jax to taint her,” Stassi said to the camera. When Jax and Stassi finally did speak at the afterparty, they reflected on their relationship and argued about how it ended. Stassi told him to not break Brittany’s heart, and he actually thought about the way he’d been treating his girlfriend and decided to improve his attitude toward her.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Stassi and Jax parted by deciding to be cordial to each other after their long history. Yeah, we’ll see how that goes.</p><p><b>James Is Paying Attention to Two Women — Who Hate Each Other</b></p><p>Lala and Kristen were very open about their mutual hate for each other. “Everything about Kristen pisses me off,” Lala said to the camera.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>During the afterparty, James and Lala flirted in front of Kristen, and she was completely disgusted. “I’m sorry it’s, like, walking STD, dude,” Kristen said out loud. The two finally went at it when Lala taunted Kristen and shoved her, but James separated the women before things got too physical. Kristen felt she handled the situation well because she’s “in this very Zen grown-up place in [her] life,” and Lala is just “ratchet.”</p><p>In the end, James kissed Kristen on the cheek on his way out as he left with Lala, and the pair had plans to “Netflix and chill” when they got home.</p><p><b>Jax vs. James at the Afterparty</b></p><p>James admitted he was “faded as f–k” at the afterparty, but he said he didn’t drink a drop. However, he did cop to having eaten “four brownies and smoked two joints earlier.” After James made some rude comments to Brittany, Jax — like a true gentleman — stood up for his girlfriend. Jax said James can’t handle himself and threatened to hit him.</p><p>James said that the entire situation was hilarious because Jax can’t get into any more trouble, due to his probation. A group of people finally split the two up, and Jax told the camera, “I solve things using my fists, and it’s definitely not a good thing for a guy on probation.”</p><p>This season has had its ups and downs, and Lisa told the camera that some of the kids have grown up and some never will. “The more things change, the more things stay the same,” she said.</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Do you side with Jax or James?</p><p><i>Vanderpump Rules</i> airs on Bravo on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBussinmKWdXaeypK3PZqqtmaOotm7Bz6ycratdoba0rYyaq2aokafBunnWam1waWlqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gang-deputies-nazi-tattoos-the-executioners-infiltrated-la-county-sheriffs-dept-illegal-arrests.html><span>←</span><span>'The Executioners': LA Sheriff's Department infiltrated by Nazi tattoo-sporting gang, claims whistle</span></a>
