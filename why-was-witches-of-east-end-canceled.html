I asked Fox 21, who produced and owns the show, if they would be willing to let me tie up the story lines so that fans would receive some closure. To my delight, they said yes. (Thank you, Fox 21!!)"</p><p>The Witches of East End author added, "I was told to keep a few of the story lines unresolved, just in case the show ever gets picked up again. (Hope never dies!)"</p><p>You can read Melissa's short conclusion, Mirror Souls, in her book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Summer on East End: Triple Moon</a>.
