"The good thing about football is that you develop a work ethic if you work at it, if you try," he said. "And you start to learn that anything can be learned... as long as you keep doing it, you can get it." He added, "It really prepared me for entertainment, in that, I could take rejection, I could go to an audition and realize that it wasn't about me and just realize it was about the piece."</p><p>The transition had its hardships. "You are known as an athlete... and then all of a sudden, you have to rebuild your life," he said. "It's very, very intense. People who have been in your college with you have gone on to relative success while you are starting over. And it's very strange, it's very foreign."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm9ga4Rwwc2tpqWcXam%2FtsDHZqueqqKueqS%2BxLCqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./professor-specializing-in-internet-law-questions-iowa-dci-gambling-investigation.html><span>←</span><span>Professor specializing in internet law questions Iowa DCI gambling investigation</span></a>
