I always tell myself to be kind and grateful but I’m human so picking myself apart happens.”</p><p>The E! personality encouraged other women to “build” themselves up, writing, “You might see me at the pool in my one-piece, but I’m showing all of you that my treasure marks are something special. They remind me of a special connection I got to share with my sweet babies for nine months.”</p><p>In the Instagram post, the former professional wrestler posed in a black crop top and matching leggings. She smiled with her stomach on display.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brie-Bella-Shows-Treasure-Marks-on-Her-Saggy-Stomach-7-Months-After-Giving-Birth-to-Son-Buddy-03.jpg><p>The Incomparable coauthor became a mom in May 2017 when she and husband <strong>Daniel Bryan</strong> welcomed their first child,<a href=#> daughter Birdie</a>, now 3. <a href=#>Buddy arrived</a> in August 2020, less than 24 hours after the former athlete’s twin sister, <a href=#><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a>, gave birth to <a href=#>son Matteo</a>, 7 months.</p><p>“They’re so close and both crawl,” Brie exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month of <a href=#>the cousins’ similar milestones</a>. “The cute thing is when you see them, Buddy always wants to grab Matteo.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She called her son “aggressive” and her nephew “gentle,” explaining at the time: “When you see them in their jolly jumpers, Matteo does these little tap dances, he never ever jumps. He tap dances. Perfect <a href=# data-link=1>posture</a>. Buddy’s jumping. He’s wild. I feel like he’s going to flip out of it. There’s so different, but yet they love being right next to each other. They really calm each other. Matteo is definitely the calm one and proper.”</p><p>Brie and Nikki compare their baby boys’ nearly identical routines “every day,” Nikki chimed in at the time. “Sleep times, eating times, crying, it’s weird,” the new mom, also 37, told Us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqpmaeqOxy6WYZquYpMS0edKtpqaZk53AbsDRnpisraKaeq6t0aSqZm9doryvwMesZJqepJq%2Fbq7Iq6uhZaCesHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./babyface-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Babyface Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
