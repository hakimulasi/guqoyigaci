It’s not all about hitting,” Baker said at the time, per The Athletic. “And I’m a hitter, but this is a total game if you’re going to win, you know what I mean? You want to give yourself as many options and categories to win the game. Now, hitting wins the game, usually. But other areas of the games is what loses you one-run games or don’t-do-this or don’t-do-that. I know everybody wants Chas to play.”</p><p>With that being said, Baker posted a .586 winning percentage during his Astros tenure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaWtfqL2wvtOsZp2to6nGbq7ApJyrZaKawaq%2BxJ1km52TlsK0sYyonWaanKS0qLHRrGSappRiwbixxK2cq6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billy-walters.html><span>←</span><span>Billy Walters Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
