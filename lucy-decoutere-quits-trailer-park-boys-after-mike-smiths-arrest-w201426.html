TMZ alleged that he pinned his female friend Georgia Ling against a bathroom wall at the Roosevelt Hotel.

At no point did I feel I was in danger, otherwise I would’ve called the police myself, which I did not. The police were called by others not present in the room who mistakenly perceived the argument to be something other than what it was. When the officers arrived I tried to assure them there was no real issue, but they proceeded to arrest Mike,'” the post read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/trailer-parks-boys-zoom-5384bcd4-0df2-4e54-bf94-653a36a87f1a.jpg><p>“Mike Smith commented: ‘Georgia is a friend of mine and we had a loud and heated dispute. That is all. At no time did I assault her. I am not guilty of the misdemeanour charged against me,'” the post continued. “The other members of the Trailer Park Boys and all staff stand behind Mike and look forward to the matter being resolved favourably.”</p><p>DeCoutere and Smith play Lucy and Bubbles on the series, which aired on the Canadian channel Showcase from 2001 to 2007.
