Gaga even wore matching lavender hair!</p><p>This is the first of possibly many awards Gaga will win this year – she is also nominated for five Grammy Awards at the 61st ceremony next month, and there is no doubt that she will be nominated for an Oscar (or more!) at the upcoming 91st Academy Awards.</p><p>Are you happy to see Gaga win her second Golden Globe?
