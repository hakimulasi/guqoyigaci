First, Universal mismarketed the crap out of his very beautiful, very Gothic love story&nbsp;Crimson Peak, forcing him to defend himself for making the movie he always wanted to make and not the crowdpleasing haunted-house frightener a less distinctive filmmaker might have gone for. And now, the studio is keeping him (and all of us) on tenterhooks about whether&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Pacific Rim: Maelstrom</strong></a>, the troubled sequel to his big-budget ode to&nbsp;kaiju cinema, is ever going to happen.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Today, the director revealed that he’s submitted a budget and script to executives, and he’s being kept in suspense about whether or not it will be approved and if the project is going to move forward:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>PACIFIC RIM 2: Budget and script went in. No answers yet. If anything happens, I will post. If nothing happens, I will just keep rambling.</p><p>— Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) <a href=#>October 29, 2015</a></p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Predictably, it’s come down to box office. Universal had a killer year with&nbsp;Jurassic World, and&nbsp;Pacific Rim 2 was only happening in the first place because it did gangbusters in China, so it may be that the studio decides not to take a chance on a sequel to a big-budget blockbuster that cost a ton to make ($190 million) and didn’t totally wow with its haul (though $411 million is by&nbsp;no means a figure to scoff at).</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>However, that&nbsp;Pacific Rim 2 is <a href=#>currently shelved</a>&nbsp;but not directly canceled means that nothing has been set in stone quite yet. With a planned animated series, as well as solid merchandise sales and home-video sales for the first film,&nbsp;Pacific Rim&nbsp;would be a very high-profile property to just let go. And Universal certainly wants to stay in business with del Toro, widely seen as one of the most visually inventive storytellers out there today.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>So, for now, let’s join del Toro in keeping our fingers crossed, and hope some smart executives figure out that there’s absolutely a big-enough appetite for more Jaeger-on-Kaiju&nbsp;action to make&nbsp;<strong>Pacific Rim: Maelstrom</strong>&nbsp;pan out for the studio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJop5qbmZu2pHnRoqRmpZGaubTA0aikrGWjmL%2BqvNNmma6cl5rBbsDUq6WenF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-ryan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Ryan Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
