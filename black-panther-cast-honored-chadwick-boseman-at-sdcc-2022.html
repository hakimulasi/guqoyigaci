We put our love for Chadwick into this film and we also put our passion. It’s a roller-coaster of a movie.”</p><p class=p1>During the MCU panel, executive producer <a href=#><strong>Kevin Feige</strong></a> and <a href=#>several marvelous stars</a> surprised Comic-Con attendees as <a href=#>they teased the Phase 4, 5 and 6 TV and film slates</a> and <a href=#>offered first looks at the upcoming projects</a>. In a new teaser of&nbsp;<i>Wakanda Forever</i>, the country emotionally mourned Boseman’s character of T’Challa.</p><p class=p1>“I am queen of the most powerful nation in the world, and my entire family is gone,” <a href=#><strong>Angela Bassett</strong></a>, who plays Black Panther’s mother, Ramonda, said in <a href=#>the footage</a>. “Have I not given everything?”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i><a href=#>previously&nbsp;confirmed in August 2020 that the&nbsp;<i>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom&nbsp;</i>star died</a> at the age of 43 following a battle with colon cancer.</p><p class=p1>“It is with immeasurable grief that we <a href=#>confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman</a>,” a statement released via his Instagram read at the time. “A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much. From&nbsp;<i>Marshall&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;<i>Da 5 Bloods</i>, August Wilson’s&nbsp;<i>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</i>&nbsp;and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in&nbsp;<i>Black Panther</i>. He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side.”</p><p class=p1>Amid filming of&nbsp;<i>Wakanda Forever,&nbsp;</i>Coogler and the cast have made it clear that <a href=#>they intended to honor Boseman</a> — who is survived by wife <a href=#><strong>Simone Ledward</strong></a> — with the final cut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Black-Panther-Cast-Honored-Chadwick-Bosemans-Legacy-During-Comic-Con-Appearance-01.jpg><p class=p1>“It’s going to be interesting to surpass the cultural phenomenon that it was. It’s going to be really interesting to see how we do that again,” Bassett, 63, <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in May 2021</a>. “It’s going to be phenomenal and <a href=#>it’s going to pay tribute</a> and it’s going to carry on that legacy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>9-1-1&nbsp;</i></a>actress added at the time: “[Chadwick]<a href=#> could do anything he put his mind to</a>. He could rap, he could dance like <a href=#>James Brown</a>. He could hold the center of a movie [as] the cinema’s first black superhero. He could do it all and he can inspire us to live our best. His work definitely stands on its own, and his work was the most important thing to him.”</p><p class=p1><i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&nbsp;</i>hits theaters on November 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabpJGYuG68wKeroZ2iYrCiv9Nmn6imn6eypXnCoZidr5mYuG6uzqycppmeYq61edKdmpxlYmV%2Fc3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./becky-g-is-fully-back-together-with-fiance-sebastian-lletget.html><span>←</span><span>Becky G Is 'Fully Back Together' With Fiance Sebastian Lletget</span></a>
