Please take another look at the article in a few days.</p><p>Lucic began his junior career with the Coquitlam Express of the BCHL in 2004–05. In the same season, he made his major junior debut with the Vancouver Giants, his hometown Western Hockey League (WHL) team, playing in one regular-season game and two playoff games. In 2005–06, he played for the Giants full-time and scored 19 points in 62 games. He got seven more points in 18 playoff games to help the Giants win the WHL championship and get to the 2006 Memorial Cup. In the off-season, the Boston Bruins picked him 50th overall in the second round of the NHL Entry Draft in 2006. With the 37th overall pick in the second round, the Bruins could have taken Lucic, but instead they chose defenseman Yuri Alexandrov. Scott Bradley, who is in charge of scouting for the Bruins, said that he didn’t think Lucic would still be on the board at the 50th pick and that “we were lucky to get him.”</p><h2>Early years</h2><p>Lucic was born in East Vancouver to Serbian couple Dobrivoje “Dobro” Lučić and Snežana Kesa. His father, Dobro, was a longshoreman in Vancouver who immigrated to North America from his native Serbia when he was 27. His mom, Snezana, came to Vancouver when her parents moved from Serbia when she was just 2. He has two brothers: Nikola, who is younger, and Jovan, who is older. His maternal uncle, Dan Kesa, is a retired NHL right winger who played for the Vancouver Canucks, Pittsburgh Penguins, Tampa Bay Lightning and Dallas Stars.</p><p>Growing up, Lucic attended Killarney Secondary in Vancouver.</p><p>He was a fan of the hometown Vancouver Canucks and has named forward Todd Bertuzzi as one of his favourite players when following the team. At age 15, Lucic was diagnosed with Scheuermann’s disease, a condition that can cause the upper back to curve and has given him a hunched-over posture.</p><p>Lucic played minor hockey (VMHA) in Vancouver, but after being passed over in the 2003 WHL Bantam Draft, he almost stopped playing. He was asked to play for the Coquitlam Express in the Junior A British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), but he felt even worse when he didn’t make the team out of rookie camp. He instead agreed to play for the Junior B Delta Ice Hawks, but after five games, he earned a spot on the Express.</p><h2>Getting a job</h2><p>The Giants’ Ring of Honor has a banner for Lucic.<br>In 2004–05, Lucic played his first season as a junior with the Coquitlam Express of the BCHL. In the same season, he made his major junior debut with the Vancouver Giants, his hometown Western Hockey League (WHL) team, playing in one regular-season game and two playoff games. In 2005–06, he played for the Giants full-time and scored 19 points in 62 games. He got seven more points in 18 playoff games to help the Giants win the WHL championship and get to the 2006 Memorial Cup. In the off-season, the Boston Bruins picked him 50th overall in the second round of the NHL Entry Draft in 2006. With the 37th overall pick in the second round, the Bruins could have taken Lucic, but instead they chose defenseman Yuri Alexandrov. Bruins Director of Scouting Scott Bradley admitted he did not expect Lucic to still be available with the 50th pick, adding, “We were fortunate to get him.”</p><p>The next season, 2006–07, Lucic became one of the Giants’ leaders. He led the team in scoring with 68 points in 70 games, which was the most of anyone on the team.</p><p>He scored 19 points in 22 postseason games, but the Giants lost the WHL Finals in seven games to the Medicine Hat Tigers. Despite losing the WHL title, Vancouver appeared in the 2007 Memorial Cup as tournament hosts. In the tournament final, Lucic and the Giants played Medicine Hat again and won the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) title with a 3–1 score. Lucic assisted on Michal Řepík’s tournament-winning goal with five minutes to play in regulation. He tied with epk for the most points in the tournament, but since epk scored more goals, he won the Ed Chynoweth Trophy as the top scorer. He also won the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the tournament’s most valuable player.</p><h2>Professional</h2><p>In the off-season, Lučić signed an entry-level contract with the Bruins on August 2, 2007. He was picked to be the next team captain for the Giants, but he made the Bruins’ opening roster for the 2007–08 season right out of training camp. He played in his first NHL game on October 5, 2007, a 4-1 loss to the Dallas Stars in which he fought Brad Winchester. On October 12, against the Los Angeles Kings, he scored for the first time. After rumors that he would be sent back to the Giants to get more experience, Lui played well enough in his first few games with the Bruins, showing grit and a willingness to fight (he got 13 fighting majors in his first season) that they decided to keep him in the lineup. He was picked to play in the 2008 NHL YoungStars Game and had 8 goals and 27 points in his first season. Matched up against the first-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the opening round, Lučić scored his first NHL playoff goal in game three on April 13, 2008.</p><p>On October 25, 2008, early in the 2008–09 NHL season, Lui scored his first hat trick and added an assist in a 5–4 win over the Atlanta Thrashers. Later that week, Lui went back to his hometown for a game against the Vancouver Canucks. The Vancouver Province newspaper had a picture of him as a baby on the back page. Earlier in the year, Lučić’s 2007 Memorial Cup ring was stolen from his home in East Vancouver on July 10, 2008. Before the game, he was given a new ring in a private ceremony by the owners of the Vancouver Giants. In January, Lui was chosen to play in his second YoungStars Game. However, he did not play for the sophomores in Montreal because of an injury to his upper body that was not clear. On April 4, 2009, near the end of the season, the Bruins gave Lui the Eddie Shore Award for his hard work and hustle.</p><p>Entering the playoffs with the Bruins as the first seed in the Eastern Conference, Lučić received a one-game suspension after delivering a cross-check to the head of Montreal Canadiens forward Maxim Lapierre in game two of the first round. While the Bruins argued that Lučić used predominantly his glove, rather than his stick, the league held to its decision.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Why Was F1 Journalist Lionel Froissart Suspended?
