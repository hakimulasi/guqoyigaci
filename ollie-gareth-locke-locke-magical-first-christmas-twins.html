"We're trying to make it as quaint and as fun as possible and we get to look forward to things like Santa."</p><p id=eW60m6vo9D0 data-wc=31>"I think the magic arrives when you have babies," Ollie adds. "It is an overriding feeling that you love your children so much. They are just part of our soul now."</p><p id=eBsAvCSKCB data-wc=24>As they talk to <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>the couple show off their two trees</a>, one of which is decorated with hand-made baubles featuring the twins' footprints.&nbsp;</p><h2>The family's 'chaotic' Christmas plans</h2><p id=eSOaoU0qGGY data-wc=24>Perhaps unsurprisingly, they are planning to pull out all the stops this year, with both their immediate family coming to stay from December 24.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ45oMwZB2 data-wc=58>"Normally we have to travel to see our relatives at Christmas. But because we've got the twins, everyone's coming to us," Gareth explains. "On Christmas Day we are cooking at ours; we've got turkey, beef, lamb and ham and goodness knows what else. There will be six children under six and eight adults. It's going to be chaos!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/38d5d3cba065-gareth-and-ollie-locke-stairs.jpg><p id=ea8O1MFDwLL data-wc=31>Bringing babies into their lives have only enhanced their relationship and they are forever thankful that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>their long three-year fertility journey</a> ended with the arrival of their adored Apollo and Cosima.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePA-PlHYP8 data-wc=40>"Every day I think about how lucky we are," Ollie says. "I think it's just an extraordinary situation: all the pain, all the tears, but when you hold them it becomes a different thing - your whole world becomes different."</p><p id=eN-vucHzpe9 data-wc=51>After spending the festive season at home, they will be jetting off on their first family holiday with the babies, to Barbados. Before then they hope to spend some time with Bex Ward, the surrogate who carried their twins to term and who remains a very close friend of the family.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Take a look back at Gareth and Ollie's stunning wedding:</figure><h2>Close bond with their surrogate</h2><p id=eVH5zgFcRb data-wc=36>"Bex is coming down with her children and we're going to go to Winter Wonderland and do the kind of things they love. Her children are our honorary nephews. We see her a lot," Ollie says.&nbsp;</p><p id=evDoNRPZjn data-wc=62>"She loves seeing the twins but she was saying it's really weird because she doesn't feel like she carried them. She's just so happy because I think she sees how happy we are and how we're actually - dare I say it? - doing quite well. The babies are wonderful. They're really thriving and are becoming little humans with completely different personalities."</p><p id=eBy-jnmsTO data-wc=36><strong>Pick up the latest issue of HELLO! on sale now. <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Subscribe to HELLO!</a> to get the magazine delivered free to your door every week or purchase the digital edition online via our Apple or Google apps.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fJhqampnn6G5qrGMoJirnaSdeq27wqScZqSfmLimecyanqKbkaF6p7XRrKtmm5intrTAzJqqZqynnru0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-piazza-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Piazza Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
