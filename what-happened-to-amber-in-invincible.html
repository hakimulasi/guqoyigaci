A Look at Her Challenges</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>“Invincible is a grown-up animated TV show about superheroes made by Robert Kirkman for Amazon Prime Video. It first aired on March 25, 2021, and is based on the Image Comics series of the same name by Kirkman, Cory Walker, and Ryan Ottley.</p><p>The show, known for its mature themes and complex characters, dives deep into the personal lives of its characters, including Amber Bennett. This article explores Amber’s character arc and the developments surrounding her throughout the series.</p><h2>What Happened to Amber in Invincible?</h2><p>People weren’t happy with how Amber’s character changed in Season 1 of “Invincible.” Fans didn’t like that her personality and race were different from the original comics. Some thought it might show stereotypes about Black characters.</p><p>In the show, Amber was shown as direct and not very flexible. Some viewers thought she was selfish, manipulative, or toxic. The person in charge of the show, Simon Racioppa, said they didn’t mean to use stereotypes with these changes. But still, many fans didn’t like what happened to Amber’s character.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-67.jpg alt="What Happened to Amber in Invincible" width=1200 height=675 title="What Happened to Amber in Invincible? A Look at Her Challenges" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In Season 2, fans noticed that Amber’s personality changed a lot. Racioppa, the person in charge, said this wasn’t because of the fan complaints but was a natural part of her character’s story. In Season 1, Amber was upset because she found out she was being lied to, which made her act defensive.</p><p>But by the end of Season 1, everything comes out, and Mark (the main character) is honest. So, in Season 2, Amber seems more chill and laid-back. She still cares about important issues, but she’s not as tense as before.</p><p>The people who make the show, like Racioppa, wanted the characters to keep developing instead of starting fresh every season. They hoped the characters would learn and change based on what happened to them.</p><p>In Season 2, the changes in Amber’s character show this idea. The plan is to keep the story going and not have the characters go back to how they were at the beginning of each new season.</p><p><strong>You can also check out our below posts related to this kind of topic:</strong></p><h2>Who Voiced Amber Bennett in Invincible?</h2><p>Zazie Beetz is the voice of Amber Bennett in the animated superhero show “Invincible.” She is an actress from Germany and America.
