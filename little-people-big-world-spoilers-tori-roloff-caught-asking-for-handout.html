The couple just launched their new podcast Raising Heights, which landed at the top of the charts. The TLC stars are also successful influencers.</p><p>According to a new report, they have an estimated net worth of $700k. This isn’t as close to Amy Roloff or Matt Roloff’s 2024 net worth, but it’s more than what the typical family makes these days, especially in this fragile economy.</p><p>The couple doesn’t look like they need financial help. Tori’s bold move has been rubbing fans the wrong way.</p><h3>Little People, Big World Spoilers: Tori Roloff Asks For Freebies</h3><p>Tori Roloff was looking for freebies. She took to her Instagram Stories to ask her millions of followers to help her out. Tori wrote: “If anybody knows how to get 3 tickets to sweethearts night tomorrow at Disneyland, please DM me!” The reality star kept her DMs open but probably got some hate.</p><p><img alt="Tori Roloff" width=730 height=338 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/02/little-people-big-world-spoilers-tori-roloff-caught-asking-for-handout/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Little People, Big World Spoilers: Tori Roloff Caught Asking For Handout" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tori-Roloff-1.jpeg></p><p><a href=#>LBPW fans flocked to Reddit when they learned about her social media post.</a> Tori wanted to get information from her followers so she could get her hands on tickets. However, some fans took it as if she was looking for a handout.</p><h3>LBPW Fans Call Out TLC Star’s Entitlement</h3><p>It’s unclear whether Tori was looking for free tickets to Disneyland. This brought up a heavy debate on a Reddit thread. One fan wrote: “Come on, Tori. I was just starting to like you.”</p><p>Another user noted: “ I was liking the podcast, too. Why anyone feels like they’re so entitled to mobilize their followers to get them stuff is beyond me. Maybe exercise a little forethought and planning and buy your tickets like everyone else. The level of entitlement is so weird.”</p><p>Sweetheart Nite is a part of the <a href=#>Disneyland After Dark</a> set of events and runs through Valentine’s Day. These after-hour events take place at Disneyland theme parks and include exclusive entertainment, characters, and more. The official website calls it a “celebration of love.” Tickets range from $139 to $169 per guest and don’t include parking.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Tori Roloff looking for a handout?
