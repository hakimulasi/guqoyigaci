But as it is now, we will have to wait and see if that album will ever see the light of day.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Tierra Whack</strong></span></h2><p><span>Tierra Whack has had a rolling career with her successful album releases and her singles receiving critical acclaim and cash.

However, she claimed that she became bored of it and, later, her mother elected to move them both out of Philadelphia.</span></p><p><span>Whack then arrived at Atlanta, where she graduated from school, but her creativity hit the slump. So she went on to explore her surrounding, suddenly stumbling herself to work at a Mister Car Wash. She made some cash in the span of six months working there, which she saved up for purchasing a Mac laptop and start recording her music.</span></p><p><span>And she finally recorded some music worth sharing with the world, which featured herself as the center of the crowd with critical acclaim to her music.</span></p><p><span>After releasing her debut album, Whack World, she became even more prominent in the music industry. Accordingly, she adapted to the change with a significant fashion style that represents her personality. She also put more effort into her music career with ever more exciting songs to release.</span></p><p><span>Some of her singles include Wasteland, Unemployed, Gloria, Feel Good, Dora, Clones, Child Please, and such.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, she is currently touring across the USA and has 3 upcoming concerts. Her next tour is to be held on September 18 at Music Midtown in Atlanta and on October 1 and 8 at Austin City Limits Music Festival – Weekend One 2021 in Austin. She has also performed at several concerts in the past, since 2015.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, she also has a website, tierrawhackmerch.com, where she sells her merchandise like sweatshirts and t-shirts. She promotes her merchandise through her Instagram account, which boasts over 770k followers.</span></p><h2><span><strong><span>Who Is Tierra Whack?</span></strong></span></h2><p><span>Tierra Whack was born on 11 August 1995 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, as Tierra Helena Whack. She is currently 25 years old.</span></p><p><span>Beginning to writing poetry as a child, she started rapping as a teenager. In 2011, a freestyle video produced by Philadelphia underground music collective We Run the Streets earned her an audience, and she began releasing songs online and performing around town.</span></p><p><span>She later moved to Atlanta to finish her high school education.
