If the extra attention happens to help her sell her Arizona mansion for the asking price of $2.49 million, she probably will not mind the negative press she has been getting.</p><p style=text-align:left>The house definitely deserves no bad press. The 7,900-square foot home is situated on five acres in Scottsdale and is nothing short of amazing. As you can see, the kitchen is big and spacious, with plenty of room for too many cooks to be in the kitchen and for everyone to come in and steal a nibble while you are trying to prepare something.</p><p style=text-align:left>Like every good mansion, it comes with a theater room that just needs your big screen television on the wall. That is, assuming that you have one (which you probably do if you can afford a $2.49 million house).</p><p></p><p style=text-align:left>Two of the six bedrooms are considered master bedrooms.
