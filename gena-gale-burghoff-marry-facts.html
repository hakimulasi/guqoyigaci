She is the daughter of actor, Gary Rich Burghoff and Janet Gayle. Her father gained notoriety for creating the character of Charlie Brown and Corporal Walter Eugene “Radar” O’Reilly in the 60s.</p><p>The actress who hails from Santa Monica, California has been admired for her stunning looks, but a question about her that remains a mystery is whether she has ever been married.</p><h2><strong>There Is Nothing To Indicate She Has Ever Been Married</strong></h2><p>Gena Gale Burghoff seems not to be the type that talks about her love and relationship life publicly. As a result of this, the media has not gotten anything that relates to that. Moreover, several sources reported that she is currently single and not dating anybody. However, it is impossible to conclude that she has never been with anybody, maybe she doesn’t feel comfortable letting it out.</p><h2><strong>7 Fascinating Truths About Gena Gale Burghoff</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/loveohlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gena-Gale-Burghoff-and-her-father.jpg><h3><strong>1. She Was Born In Santa Monica, California</strong></h3><p>Gena Gale Burghoff was born on the 20th of July 1975 in Santa Monica, California to her father Gary Burghoff, and her mother Janet Gayle. At the time of her birth, her father’s acting career was already thriving, but he only managed to appear in a few roles both on TV and in film.</p><p>For TV, her father appeared on Insight&nbsp;(1974-1975) as Milo/Mombo, and on Match Game&nbsp;(1974-1975) as Gary Burghoff. While he only appeared in a single movie, Twigs&nbsp;(1975) where he starred as a Clergyman.</p><p>Based on this, it seems her father didn’t quite have a busy schedule when she was born, as more of his credits came subsequently.</p><h3><strong>2. Burghoff’s Parents Were Married For 8 Years</strong></h3><p>The parents of Behind The Waterfall&nbsp;(1995) actress, Gary Burghoff and Janet Gayle got married in 1971. They were together for almost a decade before divorcing in 1979. The divorce came 4 years after the birth of Gena Gale Burghoff.</p><p>Even though no reason has been given for the divorce, it could be due to irreconcilable differences. After the divorce, nothing has been heard about her mother.</p><p><strong>See Also-<a href=# rel=noopener>Charles Donald Fegert Was Barbara Eden’s Ex-husband: Marriage, Divorce, Other Facts</a></strong></p><h3><strong>3. The A Letter For Joe&nbsp;Actress’s Father Married A Second Wife After His Divorce With Her Mother</strong></h3><p>Six years after the divorce of Burghoff’s parents, her father got married for the second time. He married Elizabeth Bostrom, a dental assistant in 1985, but the marriage ended in 2005 after 20 years. During the marriage, her father welcomed 2 sons, Jordan and Miles.</p><p>Just like her father’s marriage to her mother which ended without any reason, so was this one. Since her father’s second marriage ended, he hasn’t been linked to any woman.</p><h3><strong>4. Her Father Was Born With A Rare Condition</strong></h3><p>The father of the <b>48&nbsp;</b>year-old actress was born with three short fingers on his left hand, a condition known as brachydactyly which is said to be caused by Poland syndrome.</p><p>Despite this, he became a drummer and subsequently became an actor after he was trained at HB Studio in New York City.</p><h3><strong>5. She Starred Alongside Her Father In Behind The Waterfall</strong></h3><p></p><p>When she was 20, the actress appeared in the 1995 movie, <a href=# rel=noopener>Behind The Waterfall</a>.&nbsp;She played the role of Becky, while her father appeared as Mr. Cnnors. The movie which was released in 1995, follows the story of Tommy (Luke Baird) whose father died in a plane crash and he had to relocate to a small town called Erinville.</p><h3><strong>6. How Tall Is She?</strong></h3><p>The Santa Monica-born actress is above average in height, she is 5 feet 8inches (173cm/1.73m) tall. By standard, an American female is considered to be of average height if she is 5 feet 4 inches (162cm/1.62m). Going by this, it means she is quite tall than an average American female.</p><p>Her body weight on the hand is 59kg (130lbs).</p><h3><strong>7. How Rich Is She?</strong></h3><p>Burghoff earns from her acting career just like other actors in the industry. As a result of this, she is believed to have made a decent amount from it. Despite this, many sources have given different figures for her net worth, which seem unreliable. Judging from the number of roles she landed, it is safe to say that her net worth is not less than $500,000.</p><p><strong>Since the actress’ love life and marriage remain a mystery, maybe she will let the information out in the nearest future, so people who are interested in knowing about it would satisfy their curiosity.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikn6uysLTLrqqtZpOkunCzxKeYZp%2BRobJurtSrnqGnlpt6rq3Rq7BmnpGYwbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patricia-phypers.html><span>←</span><span>Bio, Career, Married, Net Worth</span></a>
