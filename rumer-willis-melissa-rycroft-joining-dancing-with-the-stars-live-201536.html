<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Rumer Willis, Melissa Rycroft Joining Dancing With the Stars: Live!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Here come the Dancing queens!</p><p>Fresh off the heels of her victory on Season 20 of<strong> Dancing With the Stars</strong>, <strong>Rumer Willis</strong> is hitting the road for Dancing With the Stars: Live! Perfect Ten Tour, hosted by <strong>Melissa Rycroft</strong>. The show’s newest winner joins the cast of professional dancers in 25 cities across the U.S. (the complete tour reaches over 40 cities) this summer.&nbsp;</p><p>“Over the weeks on DWTS I fell in love with dancing,” Willis, 26, gushed in a press release. “And after winning the show I just didn’t want to stop.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hosted by DWTS All-Stars champ Rycroft, 32, Dancing With the Stars: Live! features plenty of familiar faces, including professional dancers <strong>Witney Carson</strong>, <strong>Valentin Chmerkovskiy</strong>, <strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong>, <strong>Keo Motsepe</strong>, <strong>Peta Murgatroyd,</strong> <strong>Emma Slater</strong>, and troupe dancers <strong>Alan Bersten</strong>, <strong>Brittany Cherry</strong>, <strong>Sasha Farber</strong>, and <strong>Jenna Johnson</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Each 90-minute live show is packed with jaw-dropping and romantic performances, featuring never-before-seen choreography and some of the most memorable numbers in Dancing With the Stars’ 10-year history.&nbsp;</p><p>Rycroft won’t just be hosting, either. The former Bachelor contestant teased that she’ll be wearing many hats — or jazz shoes — during the tour. “I will be dancing. Not sure if I’m doing partner dances or a couple of group dances, but I’m doing at least three numbers as well as hosting,” she said. &nbsp;</p><p>The mother of two also told Us how she got back in post-baby dance shape.&nbsp;</p><p>“I started cycling!” she shared. “I crave dance so I’m able to sing and dance to the music and get a really good workout. I got those muscular leg muscles back from doing some fun cycling and dancing.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: The Rumer Mill</a></p><p>Even with her hectic schedule, it doesn’t look like there will be much time for relaxing — because she’s bringing her family along! Husband <strong>Tye Strickland</strong>, daughter <strong>Ava</strong>, 4, and son <strong>Beckett</strong>, 1, are also hitting the road for the “best family vacation in the world.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Now instead of being anxious I’m looking forward to it! It’s going to be chaos!” she joked. “Living like a rockstar on a bus? I mean, it’s pretty cool.”&nbsp;</p><p>The most exciting part of the Dancing With the Stars: Live! Tour for Rycroft is seeing all of the show’s fans.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m looking forward to the Q&A’s and the meet and greets and connecting with the audience – it’s the fans who really keep this tour going,” she said. “I think it’s going to be fun to see them interact with everyone!” &nbsp;</p><p>Despite the glitzy costumes and big dance numbers, Rycroft said to expect a smaller, more intimate feel for the performances.&nbsp;</p><p>“This [tour] brings the live show to you and makes it more personal,” she explained. “It’s a really cool experience.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>Dancing with the Stars: Live!
