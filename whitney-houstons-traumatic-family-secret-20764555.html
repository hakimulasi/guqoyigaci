But it wasn't by a man - it was a woman,'" Mary said in the film.</p><p>"She had tears in her eyes. She says, 'Mommy don't know the things we went through.' I said, 'Have you ever told your mother?' She says, 'No.' I said, 'Well, maybe you need to tell her.' She said, 'No, my mother would hurt somebody if I told her who it was.'</p><p>"She just had tears rolling down her face, and I just hugged her. I said, 'One day when you get the nerve, you need to tell your mother. It will lift the burden off you,'" Mary added.</p><p>While Whitney never named her alleged abuser, her elder half-brother Gary Garland claimed he had also been molested by none other than their cousin Dee Dee Warwick - the sister of Dionne Warwick, and niece of Whitney's mother, Cissy Houston.</p><p>Dee Dee, who died in 2008, had been in her mid to late 20s at the time of the alleged abuse.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12552734.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Dee-Dee-Warwick.jpg><p>Gary told the documentary-maker: "Being a child - being seven, eight, nine years old - and being molested by a female family member of mine. My mother and father were gone a lot, so we stayed with a lot of different people... four, five different families who took care of us."</p><p>Cissy, who performed with Dionne and Dee Dee in their gospel group the Drinkard Singers, would leave her children in the care of family members during her tours - something Whitney refused to do as an adult, preferring to take her daughter Bobbi Kristina with her everywhere.</p><p>Mary also shed light on why Whitney never told her mum about the abuse, revealing: "I think she was ashamed... she used to say, 'I wonder if I did something to make [Dee Dee] think I wanted her.' I said, 'Stop. A predator is a predator is a predator.'</p><p>"If Cissy had known, she would have done something about it, because Cissy loves her children," she added.</p><p>Cissy herself issued a statement after the documentary aired in 2018.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20764715.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_World-Music-Awards-2004-Show.jpg><p>"By this statement, we do not intend to defend, condone or excuse the crime of molestation," she said.</p><p>"We cannot, however, overstate the shock and horror we feel and the difficulty we have believing that my niece Dee Dee Warwick (Dionne’s sister) molested two of my three children."</p><p>Dionne also spoke out against the allegations, telling Larry King during an interview that the claims were "evil".</p><p>"I have tried to refrain from responding to that," she told the chat show host.</p><p>"First of all, it's totally hogwash. My sister would never, ever have done anything to do any harm to any child, especially within our family.</p><p>"And for those lies to be perpetuated in this so-called documentary film [Whitney], I think it's evil."</p><p><strong>If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.</strong></p><p><strong>Alternatively, you can email Jo@samaritans.org</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCrnZOkv6V6wqhlrqNfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvCnqOemqKewbp71qGgraaVrnqpu9Ssq6imo2LBs63UppitoZNis6K5yKWwZquVmL%2BmwIxrZ3BuZGqCdg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-to-find-warm-safflina-tears-of-the-kingdom-tears-of-the-kingdom-warm-safflina-location-1000022412.html><span>←</span><span>Where to Find Warm Safflina Tears of the Kingdom?
