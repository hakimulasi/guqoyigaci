Al’s father always pushed him as a child to “do for a living whatever makes you happy.” Yankovic took his first accordion instruction just before turning seven.

After three years, Al Yankovic began teaching himself how to play the accordion and rock ‘n’ roll music by listening to Elton John tunes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At a young age, he was inspired by comedians such as Frank Zappa, Shel Silverstein, and Spike Jones.

Yankovic first became known as “Weird Al” while studying architecture at Cal Poly and working as a DJ for the school’s radio station.
