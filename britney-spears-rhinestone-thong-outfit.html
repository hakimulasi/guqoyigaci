But before these contemporary style queens helped the early aughts <a href=# class=T3D>exposed-thong look</a> boomerang right back on trend, there was first the OG: Britney Spears.</p><p>The princess of pop debuted her first whale tail-style ‘fit at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, where she performed a medley of Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction” and her hit “Oops!... I Did It Again.” She wore a bedazzled black suit, white button-down, and a fedora hat à la Michael Jackson, before ripping off the outfit to reveal a whole second look underneath: a glimmering flesh-toned co-ord set.</p><p>The saucy set by David Dalrymple mimicked a glimmering birthday suit. It included a crystal-encrusted bra and matching flare pants blinged-out with Swarovski crystals. Adding even more spice to the look, the bottoms were completely sheer, save for the thong-shaped smattering of crystals.</p><p>Her ensemble even came equipped with a built-in whale tail, giving the illusion of exposed underwear straps. (One could argue that this sparkly look is the older sibling of Spears’ infamous “Toxic” music video outfit.)</p><p>Though Spears was by no means the first, nor the lone champion, of the thong-peeking-out-of-your-bottoms aesthetic, she contributed largely to the style’s hold on society, especially since she made it her signature style for years after that outing.</p><p>The singer took this trend absolutely everywhere — on stage, the red carpet, and even out shopping. There was no occasion the visible thong did not fit. She sported all possible iterations of the Y2K-defining trend, from showing off a whale tail look to more subtle choices, like jeans with cut-outs made to look like straps.</p><p>She also experimented with the undies-forward style and brazenly wore a thong outside of her pants in her <a href=# class=T3D>“I’m A Slave 4 U” music video</a>. It’s now one of her most iconic looks of all time.</p><p>Let’s give credit where credit is due: Britney Spears walked so Dua Lipa could run.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmeSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnRoaCnnaOpvK%2BxjK2fqKaXYry2wMWiqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-young-brother-rupert-dies-aged-41.html><span>←</span><span>Will Young's twin brother Rupert dies aged 41</span></a>
