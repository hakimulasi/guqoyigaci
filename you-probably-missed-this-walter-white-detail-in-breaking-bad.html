Later in the story, she becomes aware of the threat posed by Walt's right-hand-man, Jesse. She urges that Walt kill him in cold blood. It's a stunning and terrifying transformation — almost as though her prolonged exposure to Walt permanently skewed her moral compass. Considering Vince Gilligan's universe as a whole, in Better Call Saul, our eponymous anti-hero decides to seek revenge on his brother's law-partner Howard Hamlin through what can best be described as weaponized mimicry. He copies Howard's mannerisms, style of dress, and eventually steals his company's logo and name, plastering his co-opted identity on a billboard for the world to see.</p><p>What's going on, then? Maybe it gets back to chemistry:</p><p>"The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed." – <a href=#>Carl Jung</a></p><p>In addition to being an amazing story about a meth dealer in bad underpants, perhaps Breaking Bad is a Jungian exploration of one flawed chemist's experiment with the infinitely strange chemistry of human transformation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BknJpcW1frry2ec%2BrppuZkqHGbrnIrKqenF2ptaq%2FjLCYpayVp3q4tMitnGaclamuqriMoqVmmqKarqy1zaBkm5mUZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-virlan-garcia-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Virlan Garcia Dating Now? -Past Relationships, Current Relationship Status, Rumours, and Fact</span></a>
