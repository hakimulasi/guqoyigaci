Take a scenic drive to North Wales to behold the massive fortress that is Conwy Castle, walk the walled town of Conwy, and visit the Quay House, also known as the “smallest house in Great Britain.” Stroll around the Betws-y-Coed, a mountain resort town, known for its welcoming people, beautiful venues, and busy shops.</p><p>Explore a city that can transport you back to ancient times on an excursion to Chester, founded by the Romans as a walled fortress in the 1300s. Have a look around the town and visit the timber market shops, see the Victorian clock, and stop at the medieval Chester Cathedral, by far the city’s most visited site. It was here that parts of Handel’s great work, The Messiah, were first performed in 1741.</p><p>If your tastes run to the more modern end of the musical spectrum, one of the most fun things to do in Liverpool from a cruise is to explore the musical roots of the city’s most famous musicians, the Beatles. See the Fab Four’s humble hometown beginnings, walk the streets of Liverpool, stopping for selfies at Penny Lane and the vividly red-painted gates of Strawberry Field. Visit Albert Dock and the Pier Head sites. Spend time at The Beatles Story museum and walk through the band’s journey to fame, including a replica of John’s White Room.</p><p>For well-rounded Liverpool shore excursions experiences from your <a href=#>British Isles cruise</a>, book a walking tour of the city that combines historic sites like Liverpool Cathedral, the Pier Head, St. Nicholas Church, and Town Hall with the Beatles sites, including The Cavern Club on Matthew Street, where John, Paul, George, and Ringo gave some of their first performances.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSusLPByKycrGaTpLpwv8Rop6iqpKh8rbXVnqmpp5%2BhfLS0zqucZp2omMKzv8iopaw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joshua-jackson-nearly-unrecognizable-beard-picks-water-jug-calabasas-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joshua Jackson is nearly unrecognizable with a thick beard as he picks up a water jug in Calabasas</span></a>
