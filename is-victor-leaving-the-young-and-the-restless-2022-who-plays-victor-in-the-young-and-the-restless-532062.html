Whether fans like him or dislike him, he is the most interesting character on the program. His marriage to Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) elevated them to the status of one of daytime's most renowned supercouples. When it comes to business and defending his family, Victor is ruthless. Anyone who attempts to compete with The Moustache frequently loses. Although Victor undertakes insane things for the sake of his family, it frequently causes internal conflict among the Newmans.</p><h2 id=is_victor_leaving_the_young_and_the_restless_2022 class=smooth-goto>Is Victor Leaving The Young And The Restless 2022?</h2><p>Many of The Young and the Restless viewers attribute the show's success to Victor. It's difficult to picture the soap opera without the legendary character, but Eric Braeden who plays Victor&nbsp;almost left in 2009. The actor and the producers could not agree on a new contract in which Braeden's income would be reduced. However, an agreement was struck afterward, and Braeden signed a new contract.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class=trending-main-title>TRENDING</p><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can spot 3 differences"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can spot 3 differences" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/03/spot-the-difference-game-only-geniuses-can-spot-the-3-differences-in-this-squirrel-image-65e6a303545f687150017-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today"><img alt="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/crossword/2023/02/crossword-clue-home-1076100520-300.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only true geniuses can spot the mistake"><img alt="Only true geniuses can spot the mistake" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/03/brain-teaser-puzzle-for-geniuses-only-true-geniuses-can-spot-the-mistake-in-this-2-girls-65e69f8da2da711100119-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/brain-teaser-spot-the-difference-game-only-people-with-sharp-eyes-can-spot-2-differences-65d828d24ed4932993717-1200.webp></a><h2 id=why_is_victor_leaving_the_young_and_the_restless_2022 class=smooth-goto>Why Is Victor Leaving The Young And The Restless 2022?</h2><p>Braeden is still going strong as the villain people love to detest at the age of 81. In terms of whether Braeden plans to retire anytime soon, the actor has stated that he is not slowing down. Braeden stated why he's staying in a March 2021 interview with People. "I feel extremely devoted to The Young and the Restless, very loyal to Victor, and very loyal to the public who has supported us for all these years." "I aim to remain as long as I possibly can." Viewers should expect to see more of Braeden as the writers continue to produce massive plots for Victor.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=who_plays_victor_in_the_young_and_the_restless class=smooth-goto>Who Plays Victor In The Young And The Restless?</h2><p>Eric Braeden has been a mainstay of The Young and the Restless for 42 years. The actor's hair is greyer, but he still sports the mustache that has become synonymous with Victor. Victor is still an important element of the story, and the Newman patriarch is back to stirring up trouble. Victor is now embroiled in a battle with his ex-son-in-law, Ashland Locke (Robert Newman). Victor is desperate to eliminate Ashland from Victoria Newman's life after discovering he lied about his sickness (Amelia Heinle). When it comes to dealing with his opponents, Victor, as expected, has some tricks up his sleeve.&nbsp;While Victor is intent on destroying Ashland, another Newman family fight is brewing that he is unaware of. Adam Newman (Mark Grossman), his youngest son, is disappointed that his father did not chose him to manage Newman Enterprises. Adam, frustrated of being the outcast in the family, may be plotting to assassinate his father.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=the_young_and_the_restless class=smooth-goto>The Young And The Restless</h2><p>The Young and the Restless (also known as Y&R) is a CBS television soap opera produced by William J.
