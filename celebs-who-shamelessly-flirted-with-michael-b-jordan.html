Jordan at the People's Choice Awards.&nbsp;The New York rapper won an award for top Female Artist of 2018 at the time, and during her <a href=#>acceptance speech</a>, she thanked Donatella Versace for making her dress. But she also had a few words for Jordan. "And shout-out to Michael B. Jordan 'cause he's gonna be taking it off of me tonight," said Minaj, talking about the dress. She also winked and stuck her tongue out for good measure.</p><p>Later, the&nbsp;"Starships" writer spoke about flirting with Jordan during an&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;interview,&nbsp;explaining that she doesn't really know him, she was just inspired after watching him onscreen.&nbsp;"I think he introduced himself to me one time, I believe at the Met Gala," Minaj said about the Hollywood bachelor. "I was watching 'Black Panther' last night, so he was just ... happened to be fresh in my mind."&nbsp;</p><p>But it could be said Minaj made the onstage comment because she was truly attracted to Jordan and used "Black Panther" as an excuse. These days, however, she'd probably stay away from flirting with others in public since her husband Kenneth Petty, who she married the following year, probably wouldn't like it much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampiaYF3go6cnKWdkqh6uLTOZqqhmZ2auaa%2F0qWwZp6cnr%2B1scNmrqKsmGK6qq%2FHmpylZZJit7C%2Bw5qlaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyrics-cause-you-are-the-only-one-i-was-scared-of-letting-go.html><span>←</span><span>Cause you are the only one i was scared of letting go lyrics</span></a>
