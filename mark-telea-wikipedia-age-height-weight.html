Telea is a New Zealand professional rugby union player who plays as a winger for Super Rugby club Blues and the New Zealand national team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-telea-career><strong>Mark Telea career</strong></h2><p>Following an impressive performance for North Harbour in the 2019 Mitre 10 Cup season, Telea was selected to join the Blues squad for the 2020 Super Rugby season. As the first choice left wing for the Blues, Telea showcased his skills and proved to be a valuable asset to the team.</p><p>Notably, he scored three tries during a Round 2 match against the Waratahs, contributing to the Blues’ 32-12 victory in challenging weather conditions in Newcastle. In Round 4, Telea once again demonstrated his scoring ability by impressively dotting the ball down against the Bulls in Pretoria, despite being forced into touch by two defenders. His exceptional form continued in the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition, leading to his selection for the North Island in the North vs South rugby union match in mid-2020.</p><p>Additionally, Telea earned a spot in the Tasman squad for the 2020 Mitre 10 Cup, making his debut in Round 1 against Counties Manukau. Throughout the 2020 season, he played 11 games for the Mako, contributing to their consecutive premiership title wins.</p><p>While Telea had a mixed 2021 Super Rugby Aotearoa season, he regained his form during the Super Rugby Trans-Tasman competition, scoring a try in the final as the Blues triumphed over the Highlanders with a score of 23-15.</p><p>Unfortunately, in Round 3 of the 2021 Bunnings NPC, Telea sustained a season-ending injury while representing Tasman against Northland. Despite his absence, Tasman reached the final but ultimately lost 23-20 to Waikato. On June 30, 2022, following an impressive 2022 Super Rugby season with the Blues, Telea was called up to the All Blacks squad as a replacement, further highlighting his exceptional talent and contributions to the sport.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-mark-telea><strong>What happened to Mark Telea</strong>?</h2><p>Due to an undisclosed infraction of team policy, Telea has been left out of the Rugby World Cup quarterfinal matchup with Ireland this coming Saturday. With three tries in the competition, two of which came in the first-night loss to the hosts France, Telea has been replaced on the left flank by Leicester Fainga’anuku. Despite insisting that the disciplinary matter—which is allegedly related to violating a curfew—is trivial, All Blacks manager Ian Foster felt obliged to penalize the 26-year-old by leaving him out of the Paris match.</p><p>“He breached the protocol, nothing major, but enough to keep him out of selection for this week,” said Foster.</p><p>“I still love him, he trained well, it happens. Look, it is what it is. For us it’s pretty clean-cut, I don’t really want to talk about it any more. We’ve dealt with it as a team and moved on.</p><p>“We believe in what we stand for and that speaks volumes for the team that we make that sort of decision in this sort of week.”</p><p>New Zealand No 8 Ardie Savea added: “We feel for him, we love him but we’re looking forward to a game this Saturday, so that’s all I can say about it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-telea-wikipedia-and-age><strong>Mark Telea Wikipedia and age</strong></h2><p>Telea has a listing on Wikipedia.
