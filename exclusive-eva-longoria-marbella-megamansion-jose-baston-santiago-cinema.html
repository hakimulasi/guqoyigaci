It was a trailblazing role that pushed back on stereotypes, and Eva’s life since has lived up to it.&nbsp;</p><p id=eM45DoFDXbb data-wc=49>Born in Texas to Mexican-American parents, she made her way to Hollywood with just two dollars in her pocket, so when stardom arrived, she didn’t let it turn her head. Instead, the award-winning actress has turned her celebrity into a platform to do good and help the Latino community.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=0d7c9a10f613-eva-longoria-black-dress-couch>Eva's second home is sensational</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d7c9a10f613-eva-longoria-black-dress-couch.jpg><p>Black dress by Carla Ruiz</p><p id=et74Qxzt3_ data-wc=40>Eva, 48, has also taken the time to step behind the camera, learning how to produce and direct. And away from the set, she is enjoying family life with her husband, Mexican businessman Pepe Bastón, and their five-year-old son Santi.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUg8HZteOA data-wc=37>But Eva has another great love: Spain, where her family’s roots lie. She’s spent many summers on the Costa del Sol, where, as honorary president of the Global Gift Foundation, she helps host its famously glitzy fundraisers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=c1bb76139b31-eva-longoria-case-exterior>Quite the escape</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c1bb76139b31-eva-longoria-case-exterior.jpg><p id=eSt7HVFH1w data-wc=43>And now she’s found her dream home there. “I’ve been looking for a place in Marbella for the past five years,” she reveals as she shows us around the stunning villa, which was renovated by her friend, architect and interior designer Nicolás Escanez.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSt15jzdG5 data-wc=57>With a busy life otherwise split between Mexico and Los Angeles, the star visits the villa to relax with family and friends. She says: “I don’t have a schedule here. My days are full of activities – padel tennis, the beach, lunch, drinks, socialising… in fact, they’re full to the brim, but with things I really enjoy.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2>How did you find this house, Eva?</h2><p id=efkPiK_Fex data-wc=78>"The first time I came to Marbella, two decades ago, it was love at first sight. I said to myself: ‘Some day I’ll live here'. Later, we set up the Global Gift Foundation, and this is where [actor] Antonio Banderas, my best friend [actress and philanthropist] María Bravo and I held the first gala. Since then, Global Gift has grown and grown, and it now includes Casa Angeles, our day centre in Marbella for children with special needs.</p><p id=eTJOau97km data-wc=77>“Five years ago, I said to Nico, who’s very clued-up about property: ‘When you see the right place, let me know.’ I viewed a few places, but nothing was quite what I wanted.“Finally, in early 2023, this house came on the market. It needed refurbishing, but it had just the size and location I was after. So, taking advantage of the fact that I was in Barcelona filming, I came down and bought it that same day.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=cf33f734d43e-eva-longoria-doorway-photo>Eva's stunning home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf33f734d43e-eva-longoria-doorway-photo.jpg><p>Dress by Zimmermann</p><h2>Did you work on the decor?</h2><p id=eM85Lwco47 data-wc=51>“You know what? I didn’t lift a finger. Nico has incredible taste and knows me very well. I didn’t choose a single thing. He showed me the mood board and said: ‘The feeling will be of spaciousness and comfort, and the palette will be gentle shades like beige, cream and white.</p><p id=eb2QuV2Oyj data-wc=45>“We actually didn’t speak for four months. He didn’t want to show me until it was finished, so it would be a wonderful surprise. I knew I didn’t have to worry about anything, that it would be the house of my dreams, and it is.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=01b552341328-eva-longoria-all-white-house>A cosy living room with incredible views</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/01b552341328-eva-longoria-all-white-house.jpg><h2>What are the features that were essential for you?</h2><p id=eJNonUPzbp data-wc=36>“Lots of bedrooms, because it’s a holiday home and my mother, my sisters and their kids all come. I wanted a garden for my son to play in, and a swimming pool because he’s always swimming.</p><p id=eIQEXcDbyY data-wc=55>“And, of course, a big kitchen. In all my homes, I have a kitchen with a huge island, where everyone can sit together and have a glass of wine and nibbles while I cook. I love the kitchen – it’s always the heart of the house. And the one here is the best of all.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=7eaa0c9f89ff-eva-longoria-jose-baston-main-image-marbella-home>Eva's living room is a masterpiece</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7eaa0c9f89ff-eva-longoria-jose-baston-main-image-marbella-home.jpg><p>Pink mini dress by GCDS by Wonderland Luxe Puerto Banus</p><h2>Any other favourite spots?</h2><p id=eSynQ9RgiD data-wc=47>“My dressing room! It’s amazing, with loads of space. I thought: ‘I won’t need many outfits; I’ll just be wearing swimming costumes and kaftans.’ But Marbella has masses of social life – they’re always opening something or other. So I’ve ended up with all my clothes here.”</p><h2>Have you been able to enjoy the villa with your friends and family?</h2><p id=esit31EJp_ data-wc=35>“Yes; this first summer, everybody came. It wasn’t completely finished – for example, the sofa cushions weren’t ready and we didn’t have sun loungers – but apart from small details like that, everything was perfect.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=10e29dd1a33d-eva-longoria-gorgeous-family-home>A space to relax in</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10e29dd1a33d-eva-longoria-gorgeous-family-home.jpg><h2>Would you say this is your oasis?</h2><p id=eKPkDWpsrh data-wc=13>“Absolutely. It’s my oasis, my paradise.

I’m either on set, or in a meeting, or stuck in traffic... there’s so much traffic. Both LA and Marbella are close to the sea and have wonderful weather year-round, but apart from that, they couldn’t be more different.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=1e79f33d9b96-eva-longoria-seating-area-open-plan>Eva's home cinema</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e79f33d9b96-eva-longoria-seating-area-open-plan.jpg><p>Home Cinema by See & Touch<br></p><h2>Can you tell us something about your daily routine?</h2><p id=eBYAxzXUD5 data-wc=64>“I have two modes: ‘on’ when I’m working and ‘off’ when I’m not. If I’m working, my days can be very intense, with shoots at any time of the day or night, so every day is different.“The only constants are that when I get up, I do some exercise, and in the evening, I have dinner with my son and put him to bed.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=b4ac9ba067bb-eva-longoria-son-santiago-cute>Eva with little Santi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4ac9ba067bb-eva-longoria-son-santiago-cute.jpg><h2>What has motherhood taught you?</h2><p id=eu_4ze_zuN data-wc=58>“Patience. Seriously, Santi is the love of my life – I didn’t know this kind of love could exist. Before he arrived, I was the centre of my universe. Now, making decisions is a lot easier, because he’s my priority. Becoming a mother is the best thing that’s ever happened to me, the best role I’ve ever played.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=da89300cecb6-eva-longoria-posing-black-dress>Eva is a Hollywood star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da89300cecb6-eva-longoria-posing-black-dress.jpg><p>Dress by Carla Ruiz</p><h2>What about marriage? Is Pepe still your ideal man?</h2><p id=eIKZz3IFox data-wc=43>“Of course. My husband is an angel. You have to be one to be with me. He’s incredible: strong, independent and intelligent. We were both complete in ourselves, and we came together to share our joy and help each other’s dreams come true.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=2c6cbc8075bd-eva-longoria-open-plan-home>Eva's bedroom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c6cbc8075bd-eva-longoria-open-plan-home.jpg><h2>What do you think is the key to a successful marriage?</h2><p id=eeTkRaJP9u data-wc=20>“I think you need to know yourself, so you can fall in love with the other person without losing yourself.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=5f8987e10ea9-eva-longoria-living-room-portrait>Eva's dining room</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f8987e10ea9-eva-longoria-living-room-portrait.jpg><h2>Tell us more about your romance with Pepe…</h2><p id=exq24yJm1Y data-wc=57>“We’ve been together for ten years. We met through a mutual friend who’d been trying for ages to get us to go on a date. It was very romantic, and it still is. As Mexicans, we’re both romantic, but him more so than me. I try to do romantic things, but he always wins at that game.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=da62abd27834-eva-longoria-son-santiago-posing>Motherhood is Eva's favourite role</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da62abd27834-eva-longoria-son-santiago-posing.jpg><h2>How would you describe yourself?</h2><p id=eNU3pjnq0z data-wc=52>“Energetic, ambitious, affectionate, compassionate. I try to live according to what the poet Maya Angelou said: ‘People will forget what you said, they will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel.’ So my goal is to make others feel great, to encourage and inspire them.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=5460b72b9ee0-eva-longoria-posing-poolside>Eva relaxes by the pool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5460b72b9ee0-eva-longoria-posing-poolside.jpg><p>Dress by Zimmerman</p><h2>Who has inspired you?</h2><p id=ehdfXmoCGN data-wc=45>“My family. They’re very altruistic. My older sister has special needs and my mother brought us up with the idea that we have to do good, to help people. I’ve always known I wanted to contribute to society. Becoming famous just gave me a platform.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=f31183b3edf4-eva-longoria-hallway-cream>Eva's home is serene</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f31183b3edf4-eva-longoria-hallway-cream.jpg><h2>What plans do you have now for the Global Gift and Eva Longoria Foundations?</h2><p id=elAe5pCH3L data-wc=57>“With Global Gift, we’ll continue to expand Casa Angeles. There are a lot more children who want to come to our summer camp, so we need to extend our services and the therapies we offer. At the Eva Longoria Foundation, we’ll continue to focus on ways to support Latina women, such as with educational or entrepreneurial programmes.”</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=4f1c9b4c5033-eva-longoria-cream-outfit-sitting>Eva's home is a minimalist dream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4f1c9b4c5033-eva-longoria-cream-outfit-sitting.jpg><h2>La Tierra de las Mujeres (Land of Women), in Spain…</h2><p id=ete5gYJVXM data-wc=25>“Yes, and with awards season starting soon, I’m busy promoting Flamin’ Hot, my first film as director.

No one has ever made a movie like this about Latinos, so it was important to me. It’s based on the story of Richard Montañez, a Mexican caretaker who became one of PepsiCo’s top executives, thanks, he says, to inventing Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, a billion-dollar brand.“Richard had very little education but he knew that his culture was a superpower.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=434df51aa4e6-eva-longoria-pool-garden-modern-home>Eva's pool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/434df51aa4e6-eva-longoria-pool-garden-modern-home.jpg><h2>As a Latina in Hollywood, who are your role models? And do you try to be one yourself?</h2><p id=ezQR_YhCDd data-wc=49>“I have many role models; throughout my life, people have taught me what to do and how to do it. As for being one myself, Desperate Housewives made me a star worldwide and with that came a lot of influence. That’s why I’ll always be grateful for that opportunity.” &nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Shoot credits</h3><p id=eTJ7H3wimr>INTERVIEW: MARTA GORDILLO</p><p id=eqMyed3TT3>PHOTOS: SERGIO ALMARCHA</p><p id=evPAn44kZs>STYLING: PATRICIO MORENO, MIGUEL GRANADOS, JAVIER CORTES</p><p id=emHp9Yxe4s>HAIR & MAKE-UP: LORENA MORLOTE</p><p id=eskeaym2wx>JEWELLERY: BULGARI PUERTO BANUS</p><p id=eIPzWWcHg6>ARCHITECT: JOSE LUIS MARTINEZ SANCHEZ ATOROVIO INMOBILIARIA</p><p id=eqmz7dHzad>DECOR: NICOLAS ESCANEZ AT NICOE DESIGN<br></p><p id=eTX28PEkel data-wc=18><strong>DISCOVER:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Eva Longoria sparkles in figure hugging dress as she joins Jane Fonda, America Ferrera for special occasion&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJobGpoZmaCcLHXnKOuq5mrsm6x1ZpkpaeenLyztcBmpJqqkpq5ra2MppygmZ2Wu7S1zqdko6ejmnqjrdKtpqdlo5a7tbXAoKZmm5mjsq6tjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eastenders-big-mo-return-kat-slater-dead.html><span>←</span><span>EastEnders spoiler: Big Mo returns to Albert Square to announce shock death</span></a>
