It serves as the county seat of Florence County and is the eastern terminus of Interstate 20. With its strategic location and transportation infrastructure, Florence forms the hub of the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, which encompasses eight counties in the northeastern portion of the state.</p><p class=whitespace-pre-wrap>According to 2020 census data, the population of Florence proper is 39,899, making it the 10th most populous city in South Carolina.
