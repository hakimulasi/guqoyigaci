Do your best to feed Snorlax during all three time slots to make them as strong as possible, and try your best to feed them their favorite recipe.</p><p>That means the above drinks and desserts might not always be your best option — though this will constantly be changing as you’re tasked with caring for a new Snorlax every week.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If you’re unable to feed Snorlax their preferred meal, you should still go ahead and feed them something. You might not see as big a jump in strength, but any meal is better than no meal. Keep in mind that breakfast runs from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., lunch is from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., and dinner ends the day from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.</p><p>Given those wide time slots, it shouldn’t be too difficult to squeeze in three meals every day and keep your Snorlax in top shape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmtecOroKejXZa7pXnDnqqsnaKperOxwqKnnqtdpbysscyopWarnJqysQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aisling-beas-partner-explored-as-she-appears-on-i-literally-just-told-you-html.html><span>←</span><span>Aisling Beas partner explored as she appears on I Literally Just Told You</span></a>
