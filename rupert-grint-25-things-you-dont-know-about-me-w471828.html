Catch the British actor, 28, in his new role as a conman on <i>Snatch</i>, which streams on Crackle starting March 16.</p><p>1. I can carve almost anything into the end of a crayon: William Shakespeare, the Statue of Liberty, <b>Gordon Ramsay </b>wearing a fez. Anything!</p><p>2. I am definitely a nocturnal creature. I am not a morning person.</p><p>3. I currently wear a baseball cap with cross-eyes stitched on the front. It really creeps people out.</p><p>4. I like hats. It was an early ambition of mine to be a hat designer.</p><p>5. I can’t tell time on analog clocks. The purpose of the big hand and the little hand has never come naturally to me.</p><p>6. I’ve never attempted any extreme sports, and I consider running short distances an extreme sport.</p><p>7. I am an ambassador for the children’s charity Starlight.</p><span class=caption></span><p>8. My guilty pleasures are Costco pizza and watching The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross.</p><p>9. I wanted to be an ice cream man when I was younger. So when I was finally old enough to get my driver’s license, I bought an ice cream truck. In hindsight, it wasn’t the most practical first vehicle.</p><p>10. I carried the torch for the London 2012 Olympic Games. And now I use it to store pens.</p><p>11. My phone screen saver is a painting of my dog.</p><p>12. My dog is named after Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors.</p><p>13. I stole Harry Potter’s door number from his house on Privet Drive.</p><p>14. My nickname used to be “Poop” because it sounds like “Rupe.”</p><p>15. My favorite artist is David Shrigley.</p><p>16. My lucky charm is a fake Cher driver’s license.</p><span class=caption></span><p>17. When I was 5, my school asked me to write to media mogul Rupert Murdoch to ask for a donation to fix the pool, their logic being, as we shared a first name, he’d feel more personally invested. It was never repaired.</p><p>18. My favorite book is Rant by Chuck Palahniuk.</p><p>19. I like to watch Bollywood movies.</p><p>20. My karaoke song is anything by Oasis.</p><p>21. My favorite television shows are Brass Eye and The OA.</p><p>22. The best thing I own is a musical Alessi kettle.</p><p>23. While I was filming <i>Snatch</i> on a street in England, a guy gave me a five-pack of socks that he designed.&nbsp;</p><p>24. I want to visit Canada to see a narwhal. I’m not sure they exist until I see one.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I can’t dance. My body won’t allow me to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/snatch-a3c416eb-8e0f-4a69-a139-b8f69837d61e.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarraCav7V5xqugp6xdZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJuw5NwaHFqaGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./moonbin-drama-wiki-astro.html><span>←</span><span>Moonbin Drama Wiki: Astro Wiki Drama Actor Passed Away, Cause Of Death</span></a>
