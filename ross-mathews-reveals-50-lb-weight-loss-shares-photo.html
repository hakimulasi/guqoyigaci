I will always be a work in progress.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ross-Mathews-Reveals-His-Impressive-50-Lb-Weight-Loss.jpg><p>Mathews continued, “I may mess up again. I dunno. All I know is that I’m very grateful. And very happy. 🥰 On we go… ❤️.”</p><p>The <a href=#>RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> judge later gushed about the wave of support he’s received over his weight-loss update. “Reading all your love on my post about my health. Thank you! ❤️,” he wrote on his Instagram Story.</p><p>Mathews committed to losing weight just one month after <a href=#>his mother died in May</a>. At the time of her passing, he dedicated an Instagram tribute to her filled with multiple pics of the pair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ross-Mathews-Reveals-His-Impressive-50-Lb-Weight-Loss-2.jpg><p>“I can’t imagine a world without her. Will colors be less vibrant? Flavors dulled? Laughter muted? She was my audience of one, my head cheerleader, my VIP. And now she’s gone, taken before any of us were ready,” he captioned <a href=#>the post</a>. “But in her 69 years, my mom made colors more vibrant, made food more delicious and laughed with big-hearted, knee-slapping gusto. She made life better. I hope — no, I know — that her spirit lives within me and I will spend the rest of my life trying to be as good as she was, as kind as she was and authentic as she was.”</p><p>Mathews added, “I am who I am because of how she loved me. We should all be so lucky. Do me a favor: if you can, tell her your mom you love her today. I wish I could, even just one more time. ❤️.”</p><p>The month before her death, Mathews <a href=#>posted a video to Instagram</a> of himself <a href=#>working out with an eight-pound weight</a>. He jokingly asked if he can “just be fat” instead of exercising.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mathews has <a href=#>worked on bettering his health</a> over the years. In 2011, he opened up about the improvements he has seen in himself after losing 40 pounds.</p><p>“Just about everything’s better,” he explained to <a href=#>E! News</a> at the time. “You feel better, you look better, s-e-x is better, everything’s better! I know that sounds super cheesy, but I mean it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGarp6Ooeq6t06GcsKtdp7K3scClqmZtYGK5o3nWnqCgoKRiubC%2F0maqoZmimsBuvMeoq6hn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-times-disconnect-as-a-trailer-crossword-clue-7-letters-answer-1184013.html><span>←</span><span>LA Times Disconnect as a trailer Crossword Clue 7 letters Answer</span></a>
