She told me not to do it,” Faye, 37, who <a href=#>appears in season 1 of the Below Deck spinoff series</a>, recently told <a href=#>Metro</a>. “She said it is harder than you’ll ever imagine, it’s worse than you’ll ever imagine, but it’s very addictive.”</p><p>The U.K. native noted that she <a href=#>chose not to listen to Hannah’s insight</a>, adding, “Obviously, she did many seasons, so she kept going and she’s really happy now. Actually, to be honest, her advice didn’t even change my mind. I still did it.”</p><p>According to Faye, her decision to <a href=#>join the Bravo franchise came after a lot of back and forth</a>. “When I got the opportunity to come on Below Deck, I was so nervous and my gut was telling me not to do it,” she revealed. “But I never really listen to things, I’m just like, ‘I’ll do it anyway.'”</p><p>Hannah, 36, for her part, became a fan favorite after she <a href=#>first appeared on Below Deck Mediterranean in 2016</a>. The Australia native faced some ups and downs with<a href=#><strong> Captain Sandy Yawn</strong></a> — which took a turn for the worst in season 5. The captain, 57, <a href=#>fired Hannah after bosun<strong> Malia White</strong> reported the chief stew</a> for <a href=#>having Valium and a CBD vape pen in her cabin.</a></p><p>The former Below Deck star later claimed <a href=#>there were problems between her and Sandy</a> from the beginning.</p><p>“The way things can be edited — it was probably edited in a way where it looks like we were better than we were for the years before that we filmed together,” she alleged on the “Kyle & Jackie O Show” podcast in January, adding that <a href=#>her firing came off differently</a> on screen. “We weren’t friendly at all. It was every season sitting down with production going, ‘How can we get these two working together where it’s an environment where they can [coexist]?'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hannah’s former boss, however, previously explained that <a href=#>there was nothing personal about the firing</a>. “When the trust level is broken for me as a captain, I’m not taking anybody to sea,” the Florida native exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2021. “People [tried] to take my license over the years, really, because of things that happen [with the] crew.”</p><p>She added: “Hannah, she’s got her dream. She’s living her dream. Sometimes in my past, I have done things that I wasn’t aware of subconsciously because I wanted out. But my behavior was the way out because I didn’t know how to get out. I kind of feel, like, maybe that was some of her. But I wish her the best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmepJ%2BseqWxwqSqZqCRo7uitIyfnKuqmZq%2FbsPAq6WenF2brrqxjJyjmqqbmnqvu9Nmq6hlmqS2r3nToZxmq5ikxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abigail-breslin-was-afraid-to-be-alone-with-aaron-eckhart-lawsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Abigail Breslin Was Afraid to Be Alone With Aaron Eckhart: Lawsuit</span></a>
