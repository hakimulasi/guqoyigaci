It felt like I wasn’t ready to be done yet, I still needed to come back.&nbsp;</p><p>“I also think there’s a lot left on concussion research to be done, and when you’re seeing the top doctors in the country and they’re all clearing you to do what you love to do, I think you should be able to do that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/bd.jpeg><p>Bryan has been proving that since joining AEW following their All Out pay-per-view last month.</p><p>He immediately targeted Kenny Omega and is now trying to make his way through The Elite to get another shot, but we now know that Hangman Adam Page is next in line for Omega after he won the Casino Ladder Match last week on the two-year anniversary of Dynamite.</p><p>Danielson has previously said how difficult he found it to leave WWE and the special relationship he has with WWE chairman Vince McMahon, he believed he would be more fulfilled wrestling in AEW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraK%2BimsC1uMinnmhxZmWBdX6Om6mymZ5isaK6yJ6jrKeeYrGiusieo2aaoq6ur3nWsJxmmZWserOx06Kpnqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billionaire-john-huntsman-opens-primary-childrens-families-cancer-research-center.html><span>←</span><span>Billionaire John Huntsman Opens The Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center</span></a>
