The show’s stylized action sequences have not only captured the attention of worldwide audiences but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have inspired big-budget Hollywood productions</a>. After the show’s successful first season, viewers are looking forward to Blue Lock‘s highly-anticipated second.</p><h2 id=h-when-will-season-2-of-blue-lock-be-released-blue-lock-season-2-release-window data-injectable=false>When will season 2 of Blue Lock be released?
