The fraudulent activities didn't stop at cashing checks. <strong>Thompson </strong>is said to have transferred the ownership of multiple vehicles to his name, later selling them off for profit. The exact means by which Thompson gained physical control of the vehicles remains uncertain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/11/08/16994164266116.jpg><p>The Sheriff's Office reported that a credit union in <strong>Texas</strong>, affiliated with Thomas, raised the alarm after detecting unusual transactions at Jefferson Financial in New Orleans. This alert led to the discovery that the account in question had not been opened by Thomas himself.</p><p>Further complicating matters, <strong>Thompson </strong>was apprehended a second time when attempting to recover a Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV - a vehicle caught up in the alleged scam - on June 16th, driving another car reported as stolen.</p><p><strong>Thompson</strong>, who is now out on a $730,000 bond, faces a multitude of charges.
