The Pokemon franchise has evolved into an immortal masterpiece with new game releases, new characters and new surprises around every corner.</p><p>The excitement never stops for Pokemon fans and in celebration of the franchise’s 20th anniversary, we give you five very important reasons why Pokemon will always exist and never end. Enjoy!</p><p>We always wonder how the process of creating Pokemon begins and&nbsp;thankfully we found some pretty cool details about the first 151 creations! Artist <a href=#>Ken Sugimori </a>designed ALL of the first generation and has even done the various film designs as well as the card game art! He should definitely be a household name! Don’t you agree?</p><p>If you’re already <a href=#>18 films</a> in, why not just keeping making more? Plus, there’s already an expected release later this year entitled Pokemon XY & Z! Come to think of it,&nbsp;we just now realized that the first movie came out in 1998. Boy, do we feel old!</p><p>Fire Red and Leaf Green were&nbsp;remakes of the Generation I&nbsp;games, Heart Gold and Soul Silver were remakes of the Generation II games and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are remakes of the generation III games. In the near future, their will probably be remakes of the new franchise games out right now.</p><p>The lead character, Ash Ketchum, hasn’t really aged at all even though the franchise has been around for over a decade and it looks like it’ll be staying that way. Unless of course they come up with some plan to end the series, but we all seriously doubt that.</p><p>A new augmented reality where you can go into the wild (literally) and catch all the Pokemon you can! This game is every fan’s dream and we will be one of the very first to play it! Head to the <a href=#>main site</a> to learn more about the game that will help fuse reality and imagination into one full packed adventure.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/five-reasons-why-the-pokemon-franchise-will-always-exist-01.gif alt="Five Reasons Why The Pokemon Franchise Will Always Exist 1" width=800 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If these five reasons don’t make you want to become a Pokemon master, then we don’t know what to tell you!
